              <p><strong>Ano:</strong> 2013</p>
              <p><strong>IMDb ID:</strong> tt1483324</p>
              <p><strong>Classificação:</strong> 6.5</p>
              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Edith Martin (Vera Farmiga) is a strong-willed, free-spirited and successful businesswoman who takes her highly strung 18-year-old daughter Audrey (Taissa Farmiga) on a tour of potential colleges.
George Hartman (Andy García) is a buttoned-up heart surgeon accompanying his not-very motivated son Conrad (Spencer Lofranco) on the same tour.Their paths cross at idyllic Middleton College, nestled in the picturesque Pacific Northwest. As the campus tour gets underway, and their well-intention support turns clumsy in the extreme.
Edith and George not only embarrass their kids but are soon told by them essentially to take a hike. Edith and George are both married & are committed to their kids.
Meanwhile, Audrey tells Conrad that the reason she wants to attend Middleton is so she can be mentored by Middleton's acclaimed professor Roland Emerson (Tom Skerritt). Conrad says he's keeping his options open.Now banished together, these two time-pressed, responsible adults suddenly find themselves with a free day in the middle of a beautiful setting. The hours Edith and George subsequently share change their lives as they play out a unique college tour all their own and begin to fall in love with each other.George is a heart surgeon, who is afraid of heights & Edith helps him enjoy the views of Middleton from its massive bell-tower.
They share their lives history with each other by explaining stereotypes of people they see on campus & they both communicate that they are somewhat dissatisfied with their successful yet isolated lives.
They challenge each other at piano & go at each other in the music hall. They steal a couple of bikes from campus & then hide from campus police when they are reported stolen.They attend an improvise drama class where the class teacher asks Edith and George to improvise as a married couple. Edith is supposed to ask George to help bake a pie and George is supposed to tuck Edith into bed. Instead, they both end up baring their souls about what's wrong in their marriage to each other.In the middle of lunch, they realize that they have strong feelings for each other. George presses too hard for Edith to give him an answer on what she feels towards him & that scares her away. She avoids the question & rushes away from the cafeteria.At lunch, Audrey calls the Dean's assistant, and finds out that Edith was lying about the exclusive tour. She then bumps into George and demands to know where her mother is. He tells her that Edith went to the observatory, when she is really having lunch with George in the cafeteria.
In her anger, Audrey insults Conrad, saying he's peaked in life and it's all downhill for him; Conrad walks off.George and Edith then meet film student Daphne (Daniella García), who offers George her computer so he can help a heart patient. Edith and George then get high with Daphne and her boyfriend Travis (Stephen Borrello) and discuss their relationships with their children.Audrey and Conrad go to their respective meetings with professors. Audrey has tea with Emerson, while Conrad meets Boneyard Sims (Peter Riegert), who runs the campus' radio station. Audrey finds out that Emerson is going on a sabbatical, meaning he won't be able to be her advisor should she attend Middleton. Audrey reacts angrily, and Emerson warns her that she might have crossed the line from ambition into obsession. Conrad realizes his interest is in radio.Edith and George wander around more, have weed at a student's dorm room, roam around in the campus fountain "on the Friday campus fountain fun day". They end up on the bell tower again & Edith and George end up kissing each other passionately.Conrad apologizes to Audrey for her bad day, and informs her that he could see himself going to Middleton; Audrey tells him she no longer wants to go there.
As Edith and George head back to their cars, they emotionally part ways. The two then embrace their children and drive off. Edith tells Audrey that they're going to be okay, and George requests Conrad take the long way home.</p>
