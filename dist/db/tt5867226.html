              <p><strong>Classificação:</strong> 3.8</p>
              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> After retirement, ex-hit-man Frank (Johnny Messner) seeks a normal life. Frank and his war buddies Dawson (Edwin Modlin II) & others were on their support mission to US army (who was extracting a high security enemy target from enemy territory In Northern Iraq), when their positions are compromised (Dawson is shot dead) and Frank decides to shoot the asset & his family in order to bring stability to the situation.10 years later, Frank is in New Mexico with his stepdaughter Shannon (Kai Scarlett Williams) & her mother Cass (Nikki Leigh). He fixes motors for a living but is in touch with his temp employer Ocha (Danny Trejo) & sidekicks Lazarus (Robert LaSardo) & Nelson 'Nels' Salvatore (Chuck Liddell).
Nels dislikes Frank. Ocha wants Frank back on his payroll, but Frank refuses. Frank has just built a car for Ocha's daughter Nikki (Sofia Esmaili) as her birthday present. Ocha wants Frank to come for him as a hit-man and is willing to pay top dollar for his services, but Frank politely declines the offer.
Cass doesn't know about Frank's past and his history in the army.Nikki is killed a few days later in an accident when a guy runs her over. Ocha summons Frank via Lazarus. Cass tells Frank not to go, but he knows that the safety of his family is at stake and decides to meet Ocha.
Ocha is certain that this was not an accident. it was a hit job and a murder. Ocha wants Frank to kill this guy, but Frank refuses. Ocha pressure Frank to take the job by threatening to reveal his ugly past to Cass & Shannon.Frank takes the job (under the condition that this is last job and after this all debts are settled) but can't shoot the target as he is with his family (& the nightmares of killing the Iraqi target and his family still haunts Frank).
Ocha comes to know and dispatches Lazarus to kill Frank. Lazarus & Nels kill the man who killed Nikki, by intercepting the police car after the guy had surrendered to the police.
Frank is hiding (He calls Cass to try and warn her, but Cass misses his calls twice), so Lazarus attacks Cass (Cass is shot on left back side of her torso) & Shannon is kidnapped by Ocha. Frank reaches home to find Cass injured and saves her.With the situation being so personal, Frank brings back his hit-man skills to fight his old boss. Frank visits Ocha's house and finds it abandoned with nobody in sight.
Frank finds one of Ocha's henchmen and figures that he is hiding Shannon in Mexico. Meanwhile Ocha is treating Shannon like his own daughter. He wants Shannon to accept him as her father, so he can fill Nikki's void in his life.Frank does not know Ocha's exact location in Mexico. Frank crosses the border and starts hitting Ocha's cocaine joints and money laundering fronts to get him to come out. Lazarus increases security on all the remaining establishments in response.
Frank gets the address of Ocha in Mexico (from a bartender in one of his strip joints, Frank gets the location of Nels) (Frank finds Nels and extracts Ocha's address from him) and attacks. He kills Lazarus and soon finds Ocha with Shannon. He kills Ocha after a brief fight.Frank and Shannon return home to Cass.</p>
