              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Returning home from Germany, Sean Floyd plans to go to the woods for spring break with his friends Jeremy Abelar and Donnie. Unbeknownst to Sean or Donnie, Jeremy has invited his twin sister, Becky, who recently broke up with her boyfriend Chad, and her friend Sarah, who Donnie used to date.Donnie and Jeremy encourage Sean to make a move on Becky, whom he has a crush on. Jeremy assures the group that the trip is safe, while the rest worry as it took them 6 hours to reach their destination.Arriving at the campsite, Sean attempts to make a move on Becky but is interrupted by Donnie, who takes him along to pester a peeing Jeremy. Because of them startling him while he's playing with a knife, Jeremy accidentally cuts off his own penis.Sean takes everyone's phones to find an area with service and calls 9-1-1. He also angrily texts Chad from Becky's phone, before accidentally losing all the phones. Paramedics arrive in a helicopter, and Sean gives them a cooler containing Jeremy's penis.After the paramedics leave, the group finds the penis in another cooler and realize that Sean gave the paramedics the wrong one. At the hospital, the nurse reveals the dilemma to Jeremy, who is distraught due to the fact that he does not have any faith in the group.Finding a ranger station, the group goes inside. A startled Becky throws the cooler at a rattlesnake. The penis flies out of it and is bitten by the rattlesnake. After Sean has sucked out the venom, Sarah spots a drone and chases it, but falls into the water at the bottom of a ravine.Everyone follows, they swim across the ravine and find the drone's owner, a foul-mouthed 11 y.o. boy camping with his dad. He tries to coerce Sarah and Becky in exchange for the keys to his dad's boat. Becky and Sean scare him by talking about penises being cut off, allowing the group to steal the boat, although they are attacked by his dad, who thinks they molested his son.Finding their car, they stop at the gas station where Jeremy had bought booze using his fake soldier ID. The clerk cleans the penis as an act of patriotism. Afterwards, seeing Donnie's high school ID he realizes they lied about being soldiers - he chases their car as they escape and hits Donnie in the shoulder with an arrow through his headboard.Reaching the hospital, they give the penis to the doctors. After the surgery, they go inside the recovery room to find a different man named Redneck Reginald, and realize Jeremy's penis was put on Reginald instead.In a heated argument, Donnie tells Becky about Sean texting Chad from her phone. She calls Chad to pick her up, and Sean and Donnie visit Reginald, who is now awake. They explain the situation and Reginald tells them how his girlfriend, Sheryl cut off his penis as revenge for him cheating with her sister.Sean and Donnie go get Reginald's penis, which just arrived, with the hopes of attaching it to Jeremy. However, Sheryl suddenly comes to visit and ends up cutting it off again. Sean and Donnie fight her and retrieve Jeremy's penis. Meeting up with Becky and Sarah, Sean apologizes to Becky, telling her she shouldn't be with someone who cheated on her. She accepts the apology and the four of them leave together.Realizing the hospital had likely registered Jeremy under the name on his fake ID, they call the original hospital and finally deliver Jeremy's penis. While Jeremy is in surgery, Donnie and Sarah reconcile and decide to give their relationship another chance. Becky and Sean apologize to each other and start a relationship.When Sean is about to return to Germany, Jeremy is released from the hospital and introduces his girlfriend, Kendall Jenners, whom everyone believed was fake. And, with everyone goading them, Becky and Sean share a long kiss.</p>
