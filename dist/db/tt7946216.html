              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Alex and Lucy talk about having a child, but they both agree that it's not a good time to do that. It quickly devolves into a fight, because he feels that he's let her down. It's his birthday, and she gives him a necklace. On his way home, Alex is stabbed repeatedly and dies in the street. Credits roll.He wakes up in what looks like a home lab. His arm is made of various pieces sewn together. He gets out of bed and looks at himself in the mirror. He is a collection of spare parts. Henry comes in and looks really surprised, then he names the created man Adam. Henry shows Adam around and tells him he wants to keep Adam safe. Adam still dreams about his life as Alex.He has to take various drugs, including one that keeps him alive. Henry tries to teach Adam various things, but Adam is in his own little world of memories. Eventually, they figure out that music helps Adam learn. His education proceeds quickly after that.We get Henry's backstory about being a doctor in Afghanistan and some of what he did over there, and his decision put people together back home. Henry's girlfriend, Liz, stops by and talks to Adam. She claims Henry has PTSD, but he denies it.We also meet Polidori, who came up with the magic drug, and he expects to become rich and famous because of it. Polidori's rich girlfriend Shelley is there too.Henry is starting to have second thoughts about the whole thing. Polidori takes Adam outside to see the museum. He shows him different kinds of weapons exhibits and erotic paintings and he points out that humanity is "utterly depraved." They run into Lucy, Alex's former girlfriend. She doesn't recognize him at all, but he has a spark of recognition.Henry discontinues Adam's medication, something that Polidori specifically warned Adam about. Henry gives Adam his old necklace back. Then he finds some videos that explain far more than Adam really wanted to know. Adam angrily tells Henry he knows what he did and then he storms out. They all look for Adam. Adam meets a pretty blonde in a bar who likes him despite his weirdness, but when they pass by the lab as she lets him walk her home, he wants her to come in and play ping pong and gets too aggressive,and it scares her. He grabs her and covers her mouth and accidentally chokes her to death. Henry comes back sometime later and finds them hiding in and out of the alley. They get the girl in the lab and Adam wants Henry to revive her and make her his girlfriend but Henry says she's been dead too long. He and Adam get in a fight and he stabs at him in the neck with a needle and Adam collapses. Liz shows up when they drive the dead girl and Adam to the woods Polidori's house bury them there. They go to Polidori's house well he and Shelly are entertaining her rich parents. Once her parents leave, they tell him what happened and he says they should stay overnight and then go back clean everything out of the lab tomorrow. Unfortunately for them, Adam is revived and broken out of the grave comes into the house and kills Liz in front of the horrified Henry. They fight and Henry says Polidori is the one Adam should want revenge on.Polidori has heard the stuff went armed himself. He and Shelley finally this is dead body and she says her parents were right and that he is rotten and she's calling the police.Polidori probably shoots her in the head and finds Henry and says he should thank him because he not only procured some of the bodies he actually killed some for Henry, apparently including Alex. Henry and Adam and Polidori end up in a struggle which ends with Henry shot and dying in Adam's arms. Polidori says Adam is the one who be playing for all this and sets the house on fire leaving Adam there to burn, but Adam escapes, smashes into Polidori's car, pulls him out of it stuffed pills down his throat and throws him over a bridge screaming to his death. Henry pointed out earlier Adam is not in the system. He has no fingerprints and officially never existed,but you still ends up running through the woods the next day from a pack of police dogs. That afternoon, he makes it to the city and ask Lucy's necklace delivered to her. She asks who delivered it and her co-worker said it was a weird looking guy. She races outside looking for Alex but doesn't see him and doesn't recognize Adam because he doesn't really look like Alex. Adam looks at her from the street,and then turns and walks away into the crowd,his back to her</p>
