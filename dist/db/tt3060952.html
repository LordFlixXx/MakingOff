              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> A series of strange abductions have occurred in Gotham City. Video footage suggests that Batman, a wanted, costumed vigilante, is behind the incidents. When a mysterious cloaked kidnapper abducts a woman, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) arrives to confront the kidnapper and saves the woman when she is dropped from above. Green Lantern then attacks the kidnapper, revealing it to be a monstrous Parademon. The creature defeats Green Lantern soundly, and as he is about to be killed, Batman appears and saves him.The Parademon then attacks both heroes. They escape from the city's police and chase the creature into the sewers, where it charges a Mother Box and explodes. Batman and Green Lantern examine the box, deduce that it is of extraterrestrial origin, and decide to ask Superman for an answer. Another Mother Box, supplied by The Flash (Barry Allen) is being studied at S.T.A.R. Labs. Doctor Silas Stone, father of Vic Stone, deliberately misses his son's football game so he can study the box. Arriving in Metropolis, Batman and Green Lantern fight Superman-who has fought a Parademon previously and believes the heroes are working with it. The battle spreads over a portion of the city; it finally stops when Batman calls Superman "Clark". Superman uses his x-ray vision and recognizes Batman as billionaire Bruce Wayne. The three heroes then begin to collaborate. On planet Apokolips, Darkseid orders Desaad to begin an invasion of Earth in response to the superheroes' discovery of his plans.Vic arrives at S.T.A.R. Labs and argues with his father Silas, who believes that football has no importance in a world that is changing with the appearance of meta-humans. At the Daily Planet, Superman, Batman, and Green Lantern realize the invasion has begun when the box activates and several Boom Tubes appear throughout the world, including S.T.A.R. Labs. An explosion fatally wounds and embeds the Box's technology into Vic, forcing S.T.A.R. Labs to take Vic to an emergency room to save him. Silas loads Vic into a hi-tech medical bed, connecting his son with various technologies. Countless Parademons appear around the world, attacking everyone on sight.The box's technology is connected to Vic and the labs' equipment, transforming Vic into Cyborg. Just as the Flash arrives to save the scientists, Cyborg's systems reveal details of Apokolips, Darkseid, and the invasion plan. At his foster home, teenager Billy Batson sees a Parademon outside and mystically turns into the superhero Shazam. Air Force One is attacked in the air, but is saved by the Amazon princess Wonder Woman (Diana Prince) and Superman. After the heroes gather, Cyborg reveals that the invasion is a prelude to the Terraforming of Earth. Darkseid arrives and proves to be a powerful opponent who defeats each hero effortlessly.Superman is captured. Batman stops Green Lantern and persuades him to help the heroes work together after he unmasks himself. Wayne deliberately allows himself to be captured to save Superman. Green Lantern, acting as a leader, assembles everyone and decides that to defeat Darkseid they must destroy his eyes first, stripping him of his power to use his Omega Beams. Batman arrives on Apokolips and stops Desaad from turning Superman into a Parademon, but because of his brainwashing, Superman goes on a rampage, resulting in Desaad's death. Batman reasons with Superman, helping him reassert his own personality.On Earth, after Darkseid's eyes are disabled, Cyborg connects with the Mother Box to reopen the Boom Tubes and send the tyrant and his army back to their home world. Though the Parademons are gone, Darkseid remains. Superman and Batman arrive and together they force the tyrant into the portal. With the world saved, the once-maligned superheroes gain the public's trust and are honored at the White House. The President of the United States asks whether they have a name. Shazam abruptly announces the name "Super Seven", to which the others object.In a mid-credits scene, an Atlantean ship emerges from the ocean and Ocean Master appears carrying the body of his king, presumably killed during the invasion, calling it an act of war from the surface, for which he vows retribution.</p>
