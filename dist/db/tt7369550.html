              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> The world's greatest spy decides to abandon his adventurous lifestyle for the woman of his dreams. But when a madman tries to secure a devastating weapon, he soon gives up his boring existence to save not only the world, but his listless marriage.
Corey Gage (Drew Van Acker) is a spy. He meets Pam Grayson (Poppy Delevingne) during a mission where he is chasing Doyle Egan (Max Silvestri) who is on the verge of securing a WMD. Egan escapes as Corey is distracted by Pam after running into her at a mall, while he was pursuing Egan. Pam was handing out free samples for cosmetics.Corey and Pam start spending time together. Pam figures that since Corey is so good at everything, that she fears that he will never be happy. But Corey says that he is already happy. Pam makes it clear that she is not the adventurous type and would rather do laundry at her house and watch a movie.
Corey is so smitten with Pam and her boring life, that he quits his agency, says goodbye to his partner Smuts (Blake Anderson). Corey's spy implants are removed from his body, and he is a normal citizen once again. He takes up a job as a cardboard box salesman and starts a new life with Pam.
Pam loves organizing dinner parties. But she is always just preparing the house to host one, and never hosted one.Initially love is enough to keep them going, but pretty soon the reality of a numbing, lifeless experience bites them both in the rear. Corey is not selling boxes at work, and his house is literally falling apart. Corey's coworkers at the office are Bob (Brian Sacca), Fred (Lane Garrison) and Ted.
Meanwhile it turns out that Pam was a real party animal before she met Corey. She was looking for a "normal" life and hence choose Corey.Smuts contacts Corey and informs him that Egan is also now married and is honeymooning in the same town as Corey. The agency therapist says that Egan was Corey's first failure, which Corey decided to run away from. This is causing frustrations in Corey's married life. Peace will evade Corey till he completes his last mission.
The agency feels that Egan's marriage is a cover to again gain access to blueprints for a WMD. Smuts wants Corey to pretend to be married to another field agent, stay in the same hotel as Egan and gain access to the blueprints when Egan acquires them, so they know what they are dealing with. It could be laser, or it could be an atomic bomb.The field agent is super-hot Alexandria (Natasha Bassett) who wants to have sex with Corey. She gives Corey a new haircut and shaves his chest. Pam is unaware of Corey's new assignment and suspects that he is having an affair. She confides in her friend Brianna (Brittany Furlan), who advises Pam to follow Corey around to see what he is up to.
Meanwhile Smut buys 10000 cardboard boxes from Corey's company under Corey's name, to show that Corey is working in the field selling boxes. This leads to Corey winning a salesman of the year award and gets a 1-week free stay at the Pine hotel, same place where Corey is tracking Egan, with Alexandria.Alexandria and Corey pose as a couple of swingers to attract Egan's attention. Egar's wife invites them for a pool date the next day.
Corey returns home every night. The next day Pam follows him, sees him going to the Pine hotel and entering the honeymoon suite. Pam feels that she doesn't even know the person that she has been living with for so many years. Brianna eggs Pam to confront Corey.At the pool Corey intercepts the pool boy who is the courier delivering the blueprints to Egan. Corey hands the blueprints to Smuts. Pam sees Corey with Alexandria in a nothing bathing suit applying sun-cream to her back.Pam barges onto the pool to confront Corey and gives his game away. Corey goes after Pam to placate her. Alexandria rushes after Egan into his room only to find that he already had their files in his possession. Egan knew all along who Corey and Alexandria were.
She then rushes to Corey's place, where Pam is throwing a dinner party for Corey's work friends and their wives. She pretends to be an actress and tries to warn Corey, but Egan and his goons attack.Corey, Pam, and their friends work together to defeat Egan and his goons, who are all arrested. Pam divorces Corey and sets up her own cosmetics line called Undercover, which is a huge success. A few weeks later both realize that they are perfect for each other in their new avatars and get back together, aided by their friends.</p>
