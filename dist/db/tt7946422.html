              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> A teenage girl Cee (Sophie Thatcher) and her father Damon (Jay Duplass) travel to a remote alien moon, aiming to strike it rich. They've secured a contract to harvest a large deposit of the elusive gems hidden in the depths of the moon's toxic forest. The catch is that they have to be back on the orbiter within 3 cycles (days) else the last transporter from the alien moon back to Earth will be gone and they will be stranded on the planet.They leave the orbiter in a transport module but have issues during descent and land off course. Despite all the issues, Damon proceeds to take the risks, which increasingly bothers Cee. Cee is very concerned that they will miss the last transporter back to Earth. Damon hits pay-dirt and extracts a gemstone, which is easily enough for their survival back home, but Damon wants to go for the mother lode, which could be worth millions.But there are others roving the wilderness and the job quickly devolves into a fight to survive. Damon runs into Ezra (Pedro Pascal), who is also looking for gems, and wants to steal from him. Ezra wants Damon to hand over keys to the transport pod, so Damon tells Ezra about the mother lode (the queen's lair, with the largest discovered deposits of gems) and agrees to share the spoils with him. Damon proposes to harvest the gems and keep everything for themselves, and not share anything with the company who gave Damon the contract.Damon sets up an ambush with Cee surprising Ezra and his partner. But his partner tries to take advantage of a distraction (when Damon finds gems harvested by Ezra) and shoots Damon and gets shot in the process. Ezra is about to shoot Cee, but she escapes. Cee tries to take off in the pod, but it is damaged and won't fly. Ezra tracks Cee and gets to her ship where Cee injures Ezra. Ezra doesn't have a ship of his own to offer. But he wants to raid the mother-lode before flying off in Cee's ship (post repairs). Cee wants to shoot Ezra, but agrees that Damon was also trying to steal from Ezra and so Ezra was entitled to action, in which Damon died.Cee and Ezra make their way towards the mother-lode site and encounter another bunch of nomads on the way, who capture them. Ezra wants medical supplies for his wound, and air scrubbers, in exchange for 1 gem. However, the chief Oruf (Andre Royo), offers Ezra 9 gems, in exchange for Cee. Cee and Ezra both run away, but in different directions and times. Ezra catches with up with Cee and assures her that he would never give her away. Ezra asks Cee to amputate his arm, as the infection from his wound is spreading and he doesn't have any medical supplies to treat it.Cee and Ezra make their way to another group of gem hunters and find their transport ship, but it is heavily guarded. The captain of the ship knows the location of the mother lode, but wants Ezra and Cee to dig 13 stones, in exchange for a ride up to the orbiter. Digging is dangerous work and even a small mistake means the gem cannot be extracted properly and is worthless. Ezra makes 5 failed attempts, when Cee decides to extract 1 gem herself and also fails, But Ezra uses the distraction to attack the captain of the ship. Now the rest of the crew attacks the duo, and they have to fight them off to get to the ship. Ezra is badly injured and asks Cee to abandon him. But Cee gets medical kit to patch up Ezra and carries him the shuttle. Together they head back to the orbiter.</p>
