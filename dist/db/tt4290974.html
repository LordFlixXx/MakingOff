              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> David (Ronan Quarmby) is a random guy. The Earth is under attack from aliens who are somehow disguising as humans and attacking the humans with explosions that they can create from the palm of their hands. The attacks start in London, but quickly spread to Washington and NYC. The aliens have given the same powers to some humans which they are controlling, and are helping the aliens.David is best friends with Cameron (Marco Torlage). David and Cameron avoid the aliens together. Cameron is very afraid that he will be captured by the aliens. Once in a safe house, Cameron (Barbara Harrison) reveals to David that Cameron is also an alien. His species is at war with the other species of aliens. Cameron has been hiding on Earth, with his mom Ellen , for 7 years. Cameron claims that if he concentrates enough, he can scramble the alien signals and avoid detection, which is why the aliens haven't found him yet. One alien detects Cameron's scent and comes very close to detecting them, but Cameron manages to cloak both himself and David, which allows them a chance to escape before the alien can capture them.Later Cameron reveals to David that if the Aliens don't find him, they will destroy the planet to kill him.
The Alien horde is commanded by Garabon (Brad Richards), who is under pressure from his boss Devanera (Richard Sorensen) to find Cameron, but is fascinated by Earth objects such as a coffee or a Maserati. one of the aliens finds Ellen and the same gets reported to the alien mothership. Ellen escapes by killing the alien with a hidden weapon. Garabon believes that Ellen will never reveal the location of Cameron, so goes to Earth to trick Ellen into leading him to Cameron.Garabon forms a group of "survivors" led by a human controller Richard. Richard tracks Ellen and gains her trust. Ellen links her group with Richards group, which has Garabon in it. Garabon is able to get Ellen to admit that she and Cameron had a rendezvous point to meet if they got separated, but she doesn't trust Garabon enough yet to share the location with him.
One of Garabon's alien rivals wants to take advantage of Garabon's presence on Earth and commandeers a few human controllers to attack him. Garabon easily defeats them, but believes that the attack was ordered by Devanera. After the attack, Ellen trusts Garabon more, and takes him the rendezvous spot. But when Garabon doesn't find Cameron there, he is agitated and reveals his true identity to Ellen.Devenera orders Garabon to return to his ship and wait for his command to fire on Earth. Garabon takes Ellen with him.
As the alien ships Decloak, Cameron understands that they are preparing to fire on Earth. Cameron decides to take his own ship, in which he came to Earth, & go to Devenera and surrender himself to save the planet. Unknown to Cameron, one of the human controllers tracking Cameron for long, has also gotten on the space ship. The human controller creates an explosion ball inside Cameron's ship, but Cameron simply absorbs it and David uses the distraction to kill the human controller. But due to this Cameron fails to reach the alien ship.However, on the alien spaceship things go haywire exactly when Cameron absorbs the explosion energy. The alien masters controlling the humans go into distress. Ellen senses that Cameron was able to absorb pure energy and tells Garabon that Cameron is a rare species who can save Garabon's world and should be alive. She implores Garabon to somehow disrupt the cannon fire on Earth. Garabon decides to return to Earth with Ellen, and believes that it will force Devenera to belay his attack.
Before Garabon can do anything, Cameron uses pure energy to attack the alien ship, which leads to the failing of ship's core and thereby they cannot attack Earth anymore. The alien ship crashes into Earth.
Garabon tracks down Cameron and Ellen convinces him to go with Garabon for the sake of peace between species. Cameron's energy powers the ship & it travels back to its home galaxy.</p>
