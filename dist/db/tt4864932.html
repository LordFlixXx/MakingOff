              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> The movie starts with Martial arts champion Raghav (Sudheer Babu) kidnapping Sia (Shraddha Kapoor) from her film's set, eventually taking her to Bangkok. Sia's father P. P. Khurana (Sunil Grover) along with producer of the movie goes to each possible government offices for seeking help regarding the matter but no one is ready to help them, since Raghav is a powerful man. Khuraana knows that only man can now save Sia from Raghav, Ronny (Tiger Shroff).The movie then goes into flashback, where it is seen Ronny & Sia travelling in a train. Raghav is also travelling in the same train. Raghav eyes Sia & and ask his men to get her details. In the meanwhile, Ronny misses his train due to a misunderstanding created by Sia, causing her guilty. Ronny visits the school of Guruswamy (Grandmaster Shifuji Shaurya Bharadwaj) in Kerala. According to a letter given by his father, Ronny's father believes him to be a Baaghi (one who never obeys anyone's order). Thus, asking Guruswamy to make him a good human being. Ronny there meets Sia. Sometimes later, they fall in love.Sia gives him a precious ring (given by her father) & asks him to always keep it with him. Meanwhile, Raghav asks for Sia's hand from Khuraana, who under a certain sum of money is ready to marry her daughter with Raghav. Later Khurana sees Sia's ring in Ronny's hand, & tells it to Raghav. Who believes to even kill Ronny if he didn't broke his relationship with Sia. Guruswamy hears it, and refuses Raghav to do it any cost until he's alive. Raghav later poison's & kills Guruswamy. Khuraana, along with Raghav arrests Ronny to police & knowingly bails him out so that Sia does not believes over Ronny who tells her the real drama planned by her father. Khuraana even injures himself & shows Sia, a duplicate of ring which she gave to Ronny. So that she may hate him.The movie comes to the present time where Raghav reaches Bangkok. Along with the help of Harry (Sanjay Mishra), he visits a local fight club, & wins over the famous fighter Lord so as to get some attention. Next day, Some local goons chases him, and in a action-packed fighting sequence he wins over them to get the address of Viju (special man of Raghav). He breaks open into Viju's house & sets his wife at Point-blank range asking him the location of Sia. Ronny then visits the hospital where Sia is admitted by Raghav, & in the disguise of a doctor manages to get into the ward. Sia swoons a nurse, & in her disguise they both try to escape the hospital. They are caught by Raghav. But somehow they are successful in escaping the hospital. On there way back to India, Sia sees her ring still in Ronny's hand. Ronny then unfolds the real drama planned by her father & Raghav. They again fall in love. However, Raghav again caught them both, & Viju fires onto Ronny who falls into a lake.However, sometimes later it is seen that Ronny is alive & returns, since no bullet was fired by Viju (as Viju believed Ronny to be correct in his place). Raghav kills Viju. Ronny is successful to get to Raghav. However, Raghav overpowers him. But when Ronny hears it was only Raghav who killed Guruswamy, he uses the tactics of Guruswamy, & in a jaw-dropping action sequence, he kills Raghav. Later, Ronny along with Sia visits Guruswamy's school where now stands a statue of Guruswamy in place of his seat.</p>
