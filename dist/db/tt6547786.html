              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> James (Drew Van Acker) is working on the trust fund run by his father. Upon the death of his father, he becomes CEO of the company.
James and his wife Sophie (Addison Timlin) move away from the city into a suburb mansion. Before this they used to live in a normal New York apartment. With new responsibilities, and with a desire to prove himself capable, James throws himself into work.
Sophie doesn't work and spends most of the time at home. She feels very uncomfortable with having a butler, maid and a cook, and she fires them and gives them 2 years pay as severance. James is mad that the mansion is huge and that they needed the help to maintain the property. But Sophie is very egalitarian in her approach and doesn't want to act like a master to fellow human beings.The life without servants becomes unbearable as James has to do all the work around the house.
James convinces Sophie to come with him to meet Julian (James D'Arcy), a man who sells artificially intelligent robots. Sophie sees mostly female androids which make her uncomfortable. At the end of the meeting, the couple chooses Henry (Steven Strait) - a male android.
Julian claims that his company creates the most human looking androids. He also adds that in case of an expected defect, the androids are programmed to return to the factory for a reset.In the beginning, Sophie is very uncomfortable around Henry and doesn't give him any chores to do. One day she walks into her room naked, while Henry was cleaning it and feels that he was staring at her body.
Eventually, Sophie starts to warm up to Henry, and this is perfect for both James and Sophie as he does housework and makes a good companion to Sophie. Sophie gives Henry books to read and talks to him like a normal person. But then, Henry's childlike brain evolves, picking up emotions; complications start to appear.
James gets more and more busy dealing with his problems at work, while Henry starts to get more and more involved with Sophie's life. Slowly as Henry's emotion grows, he starts engaging in philosophical debates about love, lust and friendship which make James feel sidelined, but Sophies loves it. Sophie believes that Henry's debates are observations are analytical as opposed to being based on feelings and is hence consistent with his android behavior.James calls in Julian to diagnose Henry after one night when they find Henry outside the house, sleeping naked. Henry was also dreaming. Julian reckons that Sophie is treating Henry like a person, so he is trying to behave like one. Julian cautions Sophie not to let Henry evolve too quickly as a person as his programming is not designed for it.
Tensions between Sophie and James grow as Sophie stops having sex with James. James's problems at work increase as a critical project he is driving gets delayed by 4 weeks. Due to this the company loses a huge client deal and makes James look bad in front of his board of directors.Meanwhile Sophie is dreaming about getting sensual massages from Henry at home and having sex with him. She masturbates in her room, and leaves the door open with the intention that Henry hears her.
James senses that Sophie is attracted to Henry and discusses the same with Julian. Julian encourages James to discuss with Henry. Henry makes James realize that Henry's perfection makes James feel his own inadequacy. James tells Henry not to read or discuss philosophy with Sophie anymore.Henry tells Sophie that James has instructed him to stay away from her. Sophie decides to leave James for a few days. That night Henry makes love to James as he believes James is secretly in love with him.
James heads to office, where he learns that the client deal he lost, is still alive and that the direction he took for the company was appreciated by his clients.
The next day Sophie comes back, and Henry starts to make love to her while James is at the office. Henry mouths "I love you" to Sophie just as James does. That scares Sophie and she stops Henry. That night she tells James everything.James confronts Henry and tries to destroy him by totaling his docking station. The next morning James goes to work, and Henry wakes up to tell Sophie that James is a hypocrite since he made love to James just 2 nights ago. Sophie is livid and leaves to meet James of his office. Julian arrives and orders Henry to power down, but Henry refuses.
Turns out Julian was a liar. His android were not robots at all. They were humans. James and Sophie head back home with the FBI. Julian shoots the FBI officers and is about to shoot James and Sophie when Henry attacks Julian and smashes his head in. Henry shoots himself.</p>
