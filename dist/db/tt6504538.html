              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> In Los Angeles, Dean owns Turbo Elite Ambulance, apparently one of many ambulance services in the city, since he seems to have only two vehicles which aren't in great shape, and three employees. Dean was a firefighter, like many other men in his family, until he got hurt.Dean and Eric go out on a call in the ambulance they call Danger One. A man is hurt and there are no police. Another man, part of a group, wants to go along in the ambulance but is told no. Then he fights one of the EMTs and when he loses, he is told NOW he can go in the ambulance.Eric is about to start yet another night shift. Val is upset that he spends so much time away from her, four-month old Nora, and older son Sam who is sick. And Val's maternity leave is about over. Eric says he'll ask about not working so much but he is not optimistic.Craddock picks up Rami at the airport. Craddock enjoys classical music. When it appears they are being followed, Craddock speeds up.Brie is working on one of the ambulances. There is a call, but Dean says no because it is too far away. Eric and Dean talk about work. Then another call comes in which Dean says he and Eric can go to. On the way, Dean gives Eric a promotion but says it doesn't come with any actual benefits.This time when Dean and Eric arrive, there are fire trucks and cops. A car has wrecked. Craddock will survive but he is unconscious. Rami, on the other hand, might not make it to the hospital. Max, Dean's firefighter brother, is told to go along because Rami is in such bad shape. Max has worked a long shift but is told once again to go.While taking off Rami's clothes, the men discover a very large amount of money wrapped in plastic, possibly a million dollars. Dean sees this as the solution to all their problems. Eric says no, but the others insist on splitting up the money. Rami dies on the way to the hospital and he is taken inside, but the money is put in a safe place. Dean gives Eric a key.Back at the accident scene, Craddock wakes up and the cops tend to him. Immigration agent Beckwith explains that the men in the wreck were involved in a money smuggling operation he is working on. The cops are distracted briefly and Craddock has disappeared.Back at the ambulance station, Dean and Max talk about splitting up the money while Eric protests. Max talks about his service in Iraq and tells Eric what will happen to him if he betrays them, then admits he was kidding.Craddock goes to a parking lot with a valet and claims he lost his ticket. He and the valet argue until Craddock forces the valet to give him the keys to a car. Back on the road, he contacts Akkerman to say there was a problem.In a violent argument over what to do with the money, Max is killed. Meanwhile, Brie and Reuben don't know what is going on. However, when Brie and Reuben get a call and their ambulance won't start, they have to take Danger One. Dean is worried they might find out about the money.Craddock meets with Akkerman, who is very disappointed in his employee. There is a violent struggle and Akkerman is killed.Beckwith is investigating, and he discovers that whoever brought Rami to the hospital did not bring the money, so it must be somewhere else.Max's body must be disposed of. Somehow this must be done without Brie and Reuben finding out. Dean takes his employees in the office and gives Reuben a certificate naming him employee of the month, making sure the others don't see Eric putting Max's body in Danger One.The other cops are still investigating the missing money situation and Officer Montez realizes they could live a much better life than they are now. They are not getting paid enough for what they do.Dean and Eric take Max's body to dump it. But Beckwith pulls them over and explains who he is. Because they are the EMTs who brought in Rami, he says they must know something. Dean denies knowing anything. Beckwith asks to look in the back. Eric opens the door, but Dean backs over Beckwith before he can see anything. Eric gets in and they leave, running over Beckwith again, and they dump Max's body in a manhole. Which is harder than it looks. Eric hurts his finger in the process.Back at the ambulance station, Brie says she knows. She wants to participate in hiding the money and collecting part of it. At one point she has a syringe and is ready to use it to stop the others from keeping her out of it. Eric has had enough and while Dean and Brie are in the office he sets the money on fire. The others succeed in putting out the fire before all the money is gone.If that's not enough, Craddock shows up claiming to be an insurance investigator. Dean thinks 4 A.M. is a strange time of day for an insurance investigator to show up. Craddock pulls a gun, and then the cops show up and there is a lot of shooting.Dean and Eric must go out on another call. Brie goes along. This time it is Beckwith. Dean tells Eric to go slowly, because Beckwith cannot be allowed to survive. He does not. Then Craddock starts chasing the ambulance and it wrecks. Craddock shoots Brie and takes what he believes is the money. It is not, and Brie manages to shoot. Craddock is killed, but the last thing he does before dying is turn on his music.Dean admits he hid the money in case Brie did something, giving Eric the key. That is the last thing he does.Eric comes home to his family and says everything will be all right.</p>
