              <p><strong>Classificação:</strong> 5.4</p>
              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> The protagonist, Commando Karanveer Singh Dogra (Vidyut Jamwal), is a commando skilled in many aspects of survival, weaponry, and hand-to-hand combat. He is on a mission to eradicate black money, which has been siphoned to banks abroad. He is assisted in this task by Insp. Bhavna Reddy (Adah Sharma), ACP Bakthwar (Freddy Daruwala), and Zafar. How they succeed forms the crux of the story.Vicky Chadda is supposed to be the biggest dealer for black money in India. Karan is on the trail & tracks down and kills Vicky's operatives one by one. Karan's boss (Adil Hussain), the head of the special cell created for black money eradication, tells Karan that Vikcy has been arrested in Malaysia. But Adil asks Karan to keep the news under wraps.Indian Home Minister Leena Chowdhury (Shefali Shah) is a big promoter of eradicating black money. But her own son Dishank Chowdhury (Suhail Nayyar), is working on behalf of several rich people in India to launder black money. Dishank is afraid that is Vicky returns to India, everyone will be exposed & he will be forced to commit suicide. But Vicky cannot be eliminated as he has moved almost Rs 1 Lakh Crore into an unknown account with the details only in his mind.Leena & Dishank decide to use a special team to bring Vicky back to India. Unknown to them, Karan has bugged their rooms and knows their plan. The special team consists of ACP Bakhtawar (a politician's favorite), Bhavna Reddy (encounter specialist), Zafar (cyber specialist and hacker) and Sharad Pandey (Leena personal confidant and a member of the police force). The team has been instructed by Leena to take Vicky to Tihar jail & get the account details from him. Then, Leena will instigate a riot in the prison in which Vicky will be injured and will die on the way to the hospital. Karan infiltrates the team by forcing Sharad Pandey to bring upon a stroke on himself and to get admitted to hospital.At the Malaysian safe house, the team meets Vicky and his wife Maria (Esha Gupta). Vicky protests that he is innocent, but Bhaktawar is under orders not to interrogate Vicky and to bring him to India. Maria meets Karan in isolation & tells him that Vicky used to live a peaceful life as a banker in Dubai, with Maria & their daughter. A few years ago, he was introduced to Dishank and his Indian businessmen friends who offered him 10% for converting their black money. When Vicky refused, they kidnapped his father in India. Vicky had no choice but to relent. But then Dishank also started created a hype around Vicky's illegal deals. Vicky decided to come clean and wrote to the finance ministry in India. But the next day his car blew up, Vicky was crippled, and their daughter died. Vicky decided to avenge his dead daughter and moved the money into an unknown account.Karan asks Zafar to check out the story that Maria gave him. Zafar does the checks, and all the facts check out. Karan believes Maria. On the way to the airport, the group is attacked & Karan convinces Bakhtawar to divert the boat to Thailand, where Vicky claims he has hidden the money. When Bakhtawar resists, Karan shoots him (only injures him slightly) to escape with the rest.At a secluded spot, Maria reveals herself to be the real Vicky and shoots the man posing to be Vicky. She leaves with her entourage but after shooting Zafar. After recovering Karan & Bhavna decide to stop Vicky from accessing the money. But while they pursue Vicky, Bakhtawar and his entire team tracks Bhavna and Karan. Karan corners Vicky and is about to arrest her when Bakhtawar arrives, disarms Karan & makes a deal with Vicky to help her escape for a 10% commission.Now Karan and Vicky engage in a cat and mouse game. Karan starts to track Vicky's hiding location & Vicky starts to eliminate all his leads. So, Karan pretends that he and Bhavna have been arrested by Indian authorities and deported. This leads Vicky in a false sense of security.
Karan now is able to track a hacker who is working for Vicky to identify Lakhs of dead people who forgot to close their bank accounts. The hacker is hacking those accounts, so Vicky can transfer the money in her account to these accounts in small denominations, making it impossible to track. From there, the money would be slowly transferred to any account of Vicky's choosing. All Vicky needs is her own laptop from the bank locker which she can use to initiate the transfer.
Karan survives the bank locker but finds that Vicky has send many men of the same description to extract the laptop. But Karan uses infra-red glasses to find which man has the laptop. Karan tracks the laptop to get to Vicky, but is engaged by Bakhtawar, and Vicky is able to complete the transfer.Once it is done, Karan reveals that this was all a big plan from the beginning. Vicky had not transferred the money into accounts of dead people but the accounts of 3 Crore Indian farmers. Karan has switched the program of the hacker, before it was delivered to Vicky. Leena was involved in the plan & so was Bakhtawar, since Leena knew that Vicky's enemies would make different plans if she did not take control of the situation.
Bhavna kills Vicky to avenge Zafar.</p>
