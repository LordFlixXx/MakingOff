              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> The movie begins three years after the events of the Psych series finale. On a dilapidated boat in the harbor, there appears to be a black market flea market going on including guns, jewelry, etc. Shawn Spencer (James Roday Rodriguez) is dressed up in a costume as Hagrid from Harry Potter and is rummaging through items on a table. He is noticed by El Proveedor (Robert La Sardo), the criminal fence running the sale. El Proveedor questions Shawn as to what he is doing. After Shawn responds with silly answers, El Proveedor's henchmen pull guns on Shawn. This causes all the other criminals on the boat to all pull guns on each other. During the confusion caused by this, Shawn grabs a sack of stolen jewelry and makes a run for it. Shawn uses the beard from the costume to zip-line off the boat. El Proveedor and his henchmen chase Shawn. Once Shawn makes it to an alley and doesn't see his pursuers behind him anymore, he searches the sack of jewelry but doesn't find what he was searching for. His pursuers catch up to him, so Shawn dumps the jewelry onto the ground and runs through the back door of a building. The building is an office building and the workplace of Burton Guster "Gus" (Dule' Hill). Shawn finds Gus' office and hides under his desk. Gus, who is currently sitting at his desk eating lunch, remarks about not giving Shawn permission to borrow his Hagrid costume. Shawn asks Gus to pull the fire alarm and for half of the sandwich Gus is eating. Gus walks out into the hallway and tells Shawn's pursuers the man they are chasing got onto the elevator. They head toward the lobby thinking Shawn is leaving the building. Gus returns to his office to see Shawn has disappeared and so has the sandwich Gus was eating.Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) is sitting in her work vehicle when her partner Sam Sloane (Sam Huntington) returns to the car with two coffees complaining how far he had to go to find a place that had any of the nut milks. Juliet tells Sam they nabbed 8 suspects on their sting operation where they have left a cell phone and shopping bag unattended at a table outside a nearby cafe and arrest anyone they witness try to steal the items. They are about to end for the day when they see the items get picked up by another suspect. They decide to get this one more, and Juliet gets out of the car. The suspect sees Juliet, whose police badge is visible on her belt, and turns around and runs. Juliet seemingly knows the likely intended escape route of the suspect and walks around the back of the building to an alley where the suspect almost runs right into her. Juliet is surprised when the suspect looks up, and Juliet sees it is Iris Vick (Emma Tremblay), Chief Vick's daughter. Iris begs Juliet to let her go and puts the stolen items on the ground. Juliet tells her to run away. When Sam catches up to Juliet, he seems to know something is weird about the situation but doesn't push the issue.Later that night, Sam walks into his apartment and realizes his alarm system has already been disarmed. An intruder starts talking to Sam, who recognizes the voice as "Billy." The Thin White Duke "Duke" (Zachary Levi) remarks he never really looked like a Billy and to call him the Duke. Sam makes a joke about the new name and look, smashes a gingerbread house on the table next to him, and pulls out the gun that was hidden inside pointing it at Duke. Duke laughs and tells Sam he no longer works alone. Duke's two partners, Heather Rockrear (Ashley Fliehr) and the Black Gentleman Ninja "BGN" (Nathan Mitchell) as they are eventually named by Shawn and Gus, enter from another room behind Sam pointing guns at him. Sam tries to negotiate, but Heather and BGN shoot Sam.The next morning, Juliet shows up at the Chief's house to talk about the situation involving her daughter, Iris. Chief Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson) says she just has to get her husband off to the airport, and then they can ride into work together. Once Karen is out of the room, Iris comes downstairs and begs Juliet not to tell her mom. Iris says she was put up to the theft by these horrible girls at school who bully everyone. Juliet agrees not to tell Karen and has Iris promise to call Juliet if she any more problems with those girls or anyone else. They pinky promise right as Karen comes back into the room who comments she is jealous of how close Iris and Juliet are. When Juliet and Karen get in the car, Juliet tells Karen never mind about what she wanted to talk to her about. This prompts Karen to say she knows what it was about, Juliet's relationship with Shawn. Juliet says that's not it, and she's not in a rush to get married. Karen comments how she notices Juliet doesn't wear an engagement ring despite being engaged to Shawn. Juliet then gets a call informing her Sam has been shot.El Proveedor is interrogating the man who came on the boat right before Shawn to find out Shawn's identity, but the man doesn't know anything. One of El Proveedor's henchmen comes in saying they found something on the beard dropped by Shawn after zip-lining off the boat. Inside the beard is a sewn in patch that says, "Property of Burton Guster." El Proveedor tells his henchmen to find Burton Guster.Gus enters the Psych office which is underground in an alley in Chinatown. When Gus enters, Shawn comments how he just finished decorating the place to match the shop from the 30th anniversary edition of Gremlins. Gus comments that the problem is the name of the business which is "psychphrancisco." Shawn disagrees and tells Gus they have a case. Shawn tells Gus that Juliet's partner Sam has been shot and is in the ICU. Gus expresses surprise the police would hire them for the case. Shawn admits they haven't actually been hired by the police yet but plans to get them on the case. He convinces Gus to go by promising to stop at every Cinnabon between the office and the hospital, and they will be done in time to go to a planetarium party Gus wants to attend later that night.Shawn and Gus arrive at the hospital. Sam's hospital room is filled with cops. Shawn and Gus stand in the back when Karen starts to give a briefing. Shawn and Gus start talking which gets Karen's attention, and she asks who is back there. Shawn and Gus move in front of all the cops and say they are there to pay their respects to Sam. Karen continues with her briefing. She says the only thing that was taken from Sam's apartment is his dongle, a security device that allows access to confidential police files. Shawn childishly takes dongle to be a penis metaphor, and after making inappropriate comments and not being able to control his laughter when the dongle is described as purple and curved, Juliet takes Shawn and Gus aside and basically kicks them out of the hospital saying they are not allowed to help with the investigation.Once outside the hospital, Shawn and Gus are discreetly called to the side of the building by Nick Conforth (Ralph Macchio). Nick is an instructor at the Santa Barbara Police Academy that Shawn and Gus had to attend during a previous episode. Nick says he came to see Sam who he knows when he was Sam's instructor at the academy until Juliet kicked him out of the hospital too. Nick says that Juliet is hiding something, but Shawn and Gus doubt him. Nick says that Sam called him yesterday saying no one could be trusted, especially not Juliet. Sam told Nick he kept getting phone calls talking about The Crimes of Juliet. Sam traced the number to a specific cellphone tower, but Sam was shot before he had the chance to check it out. Since Nick is an instructor because he is terrified to work in the field as an officer, he asks Shawn and Gus to check it out.When Shawn and Gus find the cellphone tower, the only thing anywhere nearby is a mental hospital. Dusk sets in as Shawn and Gus drive up to the locked gate of the mental hospital. A sign on the front gate says the hospital has been closed for two years. They approach the hospital while hearing weird animal noises which Shawn realizes is Gus playing Pokemon Go on his phone. Shawn notices someone has tapped into the power lines and ran a cable into the hospital. Shawn and Gus enter through a submarine looking door into a dark hallway where they see a light at the end. An attack dog chases them back through the door. Shawn realizes by the dog's collar that he is a rescue. He enters the door again and tries to calm the dog using a trick he saw on the Dog Whisperer. The trick doesn't work, but then Shawn notices Gus eating beef jerky. Shawn makes Gus give him the jerky to give to the dog. Once Shawn gives the jerky to the dog, the dog calms down and likes Shawn letting him pet him. Shawn and Gus make their way down the hallway to a room full of computer monitors. They see Sam's dongle plugged into the computer and see various police files open on the screens. Shawn is scrolling through the documents when they see a manifesto pop up called The Crimes of Juliet O'Hara. Shawn and Gus hear a door slam shut and hide. Duke, Heather, and BNG walk into the room. Duke realizes someone has been there and orders the other two to do a perimeter search. Duke sees the manifesto up on the screen and says they will have to speed up their plan. Shawn and Gus run out of the hospital, but then Shawn runs back into the hospital and back out again with the attack dog in his arms. Shawn and Gus get into the Driver's Ed car they stole in the series finale that has a steering wheel and pedals on both the driver's and passenger's side of the car and take forever to turn around as they are both trying to drive.Karen wakes up. She looks out her bedroom window and notices lights in her garage. She opens the garage to find Shawn, Gus, and the dog. Shawn said they are there to gift Karen the dog and tells her about the mental hospital. When the dog starts barking at Karen, she does the trick from the Dog Whisperer tried by Shawn earlier, but it works this time and the dog stops barking and lays down. Shawn tells Karen he tried to contact Juliet to tell her about the hospital as well, but Juliet hasn't responded.Shawn, Gus, and Karen all go to the mental hospital. Shawn leads them to the same room they were in earlier with all the monitors and Sam's dongle, but the room is now completely empty. They hear someone coming. It's Juliet. She came to help Shawn and Gus, who she knew were there because of all the traffic violations they committed while speeding away from the hospital. Juliet yells at Shawn and Gus for getting involved in the case after she told them not to and tells them to leave and go to their planetarium party.Shawn and Gus enter the planetarium party. Gus notices a girl across the room and starts talking about approaching her. Before he has the chance, the girl makes eye contact and starts approaching Gus which makes Gus uncomfortable. They introduce themselves. Selene (Jazmyn Simon) then invites Gus to look through the telescope with her.Juliet tells Karen she may have an idea who is behind everything, but she needs to pursue the lead alone. Karen says no, but Juliet asks Karen to trust her. Karen gives her 24 hours, but Juliet says she'll only need 12 if Sam wakes up so she's going to the hospital.Back at the party, Selene is looking through the telescope saying that's where the 9th planet would be if the telescope were powerful enough. Gus laughs and then corrects her telling her Pluto is located somewhere else in the sky. She questions him as to why she would be showing him Pluto and says she is talking about Eris. Gus laughs saying the dwarf planet Eris is stupid and that Pluto will always be the 9th planet. They argue back and forth with each other until Selene starts kissing Gus. Gus seems uncomfortable with Selene being so aggressive and storms off. Shawn yells after Gus that this is probably his best chance ever of finding a wife.At the hospital, Juliet walks out of the elevator. As she approaches Sam's room, she sees various hospital staff running around tending to two police officers who have been shot outside Sam's room. Inside Sam's room, she sees a doctor using a defibrillator on Sam who is dead. Then we see Duke's partner Heather wearing pink scrubs getting onto the elevator.At the morgue, Medical Examiner Dr. Butterfly McMillan (Julianna Guill) pulls the sheet over Sam's face and apologizes to Juliet, Shawn, and Gus for the missing report as her assistant must have misplaced it. The assistant comes out of the back, and it is Woody Strode (Kurt Fuller), the former Santa Barbara Medical Examiner. Everyone is surprised to see each other. Woody explains he had gotten the position of Head Medical Examiner for the state of California, but he got fired for leaving a chili dog inside a cadaver and then opening the cadaver back up to retrieve the chili dog. Juliet refocuses Butterfly who says the cause of death was asphyxiation. Then Selene shows up out of no where screaming for Gus before walking into the morgue. Gus asks Selene if she is there because she works there. Selene says no, and that she saw Gus' Instagram post about going to the morgue so she stopped by. Gus takes Selene into the hallway to talk. Selene cuts Gus off before he can say anything telling him she took his business card and checked him out. Selene says she likes everything she found, so she chooses Gus. Butterfly tries to get back to what she was talking about when she finds something inside Sam's stomach. Gus tells Selene she doesn't even know him which prompts her to go off on a long tangent about all the things she knows about him including things from his childhood. While Gus starts telling her all the things she shouldn't be doing, Shawn points out to Woody that Gus has done all those things before. Woody points out that Gus is getting "Gused" which is why he doesn't like it. Selene tells Gus his points are completely fair, leaves him her dating "resume," and gives him a Fluffernutter sandwich which she found out from Gus' mother is his favorite. Butterfly is finally able to retrieve the item from Sam's stomach which is Sam's dongle. They plug the dongle into a computer, but the only thing still on it is the manifesto "The Crimes of Juliet O'Hara."Shawn and Gus are walking back to their office. Shawn is talking about how it worries him not knowing what is going on with Juliet. When they enter the office, they are grabbed by El Proveedor's henchmen. El Proveedor comments that people that steal from him usually run further away. Gus argues that Shawn didn't mean to steal and was just working a case. El Proveedor threatens Shawn to tell him who the client is. After some reluctance, Shawn admits he himself is the client, and he is looking for the engagement ring he gave Juliet that was immediately stolen right after proposing. Gus flips out on Shawn saying Shawn has been ruining their business the last three years looking for this ring. El Proveedor asks Shawn if he has considered whether Shawn is using the ring as an excuse for his fear of change. El Proveedor tells his men to kill Shawn and Gus. Shawn mentions he is a psychic detective which prompts El Proveedor to make Shawn predict his future. Shawn tells El Proveedor of three predictions, one involving a bus and curb, one involving a tax issue, and that he must lay off the salt. El Proveedor says he'll see how the predictions play out and then decide whether to kill Shawn and Gus.Shawn and Gus go to Shawn and Juliet's apartment where Juliet is sitting on the couch looking at a wall of paperwork she has taped up. She apologizes to Shawn for how she's been acting and asks for his help. The paperwork on the wall is the paperwork from all the cases mentioned in the manifesto. Juliet implies there is some truth to the manifesto. While all of the suspects in those cases are guilty, she has done some things of which she's not proud. Juliet says she's "fudged" some rules and skipped some protocols to put these bad guys away. Shawn reassures her she is fine as she did not do anything illegal and that he has lied for years about being psychic just to put bad guys away. Shawn then looks over the paperwork on the wall using his hyper-observance taught to him by his father and determines it is not any of the suspects from the cases. It's the confidential informant from all the cases, Billy McGoldrick (Duke). Juliet says he informed on all of the suspects from those cases. Gus asks what his beef is then. Juliet says she still sent him to jail. Gus mentions that Billy must be the person following Juliet which prompts Shawn to remember a surveillance picture he'd seen of Juliet on the computer screen at the mental hospital. Remembering the picture, Shawn realizes Juliet had her house keys in her hand meaning she must have been close to the door of their apartment building. Shawn goes to the window and looks down at exactly where Juliet was when the picture was taken. Shawn realizes it was from the opposite side, so the picture must have been taken from a building across the street. As Shawn looks up at the building across the street, he sees Duke looking out and makes eye contact with him.Shawn, Gus, and Juliet all run downstairs and out into the street. Duke runs outside as well. Juliet pulls her gun on him telling him to freeze, and Duke runs back inside. Shawn, Gus, and Juliet follow the Duke inside and a shootout occurs. Duke throws down his gun saying while he would love to kill Juliet, he has promised he would not do that yet. He backs away while Juliet holds him at gun point until he is close enough to roll back through a doorway and then hits a button causing a metal door to slam down shut between Juliet and him.Back in Shawn and Juliet's apartment, Gus is about to eat something when Shawn calls him over to the window to look at a weird looking guy trying to enter the building. When the weird guy looks up, Shawn realizes it is his father, Henry Spencer (Corbin Bernsen). Shawn is surprised to see his father dressed like a hipster. Juliet comes home and is surprised to see Henry. Henry tells her he wasn't going to stay home when someone is targeting her. Juliet doesn't want anyone else to be in danger.Juliet and Shawn are in bed talking. Shawn is trying to reassure her, but Juliet has difficulty accepting the help. She steps out onto the balcony and calls her former partner Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) on FaceTime. Carlton says he spoke with Henry and is aware of the situation. Juliet tells him it's all her fault as she "colored out of the lines." Carlton offers to come from Santa Barbara to help, but Juliet tells him she can handle it.Shawn wakes up after hearing a noise. He walks past a sleeping Gus on the couch and goes into the kitchen where he sees someone from behind squatting down. The person stands up and turns around. It's Mary Lightly (Jimmi Simpson). Shawn now knows he is dreaming since Mary was murdered by the serial killer Mr. Yin in a previous episode. Shawn confirms this by looking back into the living room where he says a pony that tells him to stay golden. Mary asks Shawn how his girl is doing, and Shawn tells him how he's worried he's going to lose her if he doesn't find the ring soon. Mary says he knows what Shawn needs. Mary pulls out a guitar and starts singing Allison Road by the Gin Blossoms. Shawn joins in singing along with a holographic Princess Leia dressed Juliet and Prince dressed Gus. Shawn is then woken up by Henry yelling at him to get up.At Karen's house, Iris walks outside when her cell phone starts to ring. It's Mischa, one of the mean girls from school. Iris answers the phone and tells Mischa off. Iris walks around the corner where Duke is standing and compliments her on her courage standing up to Mischa on the phone. Iris says thanks, but she does not talk to strangers. As Iris starts walking away, Duke comes up behind her holding a Chloroform soaked cloth over her mouth causing her to pass out.Karen is at the harbor in front of Duke. Duke remarks he's surprised Karen arrived before Juliet considering Juliet is so close to Iris. Juliet shows up with Shawn, Gus, Henry, and Woody right behind. Duke complains as Juliet was supposed to come alone and has to call in on the radio about the additional people. Whomever Duke talks to on the radio says everyone can come as it was not unexpected for everyone to show up. Duke has everyone put any guns they have in one boat and then get into another boat. Duke then gets into the boat and takes them all to Alcatraz. They all walk into a cell block. At the end, a spotlight comes on on a balcony where Duke, Heather, and BGN are all standing. Karen asks what Duke has done with Iris.Duke tells Karen to be quiet and goes off on a tangent. Duke mentions his job is done and is now going to introduce tonight's headliner. He starts to go off on another tangent, but is then shot in the back and falls over. From behind walks out Allison Cowley (Mena Suvari) who was Mr. Yin's assistant and arrested by Juliet the same night Mr. Yin was killed. Shawn then realizes the significance of his dream and the song in it, Allison Road. Shawn starts talking about the dream and all the details causing Allison to shoot more bullets into Duke's body on the ground to shut him up and regain everyone's attention. Shawn asks Allison why she just shot her partner. Allison says Duke was no longer useful. While Allison is going on about her plan, Gus points out to Shawn that the cheese cloth used by the workers doing the restoration project workers off to the side is not hanging straight down the way it should be giving them a possible hint about where to go to find Iris. Allison gets annoyed at Shawn and Gus not paying attention. Juliet asks Allison what she wants. Allison says she wants a do over as Juliet arrested her on the night she was supposed to be taking over as a serial killer for Mr. Yin. As Allison is pondering aloud her overuse of similes, Shawn points out the clue about the cheese cloth to Karen. Allison tells Karen that Iris is hidden somewhere in the building and explosives are involved. Allison tells everyone other then Karen and Juliet they will have to fight her colleagues, Heather and BGN.Karen runs off to start looking for Iris. Allison says go and turns off the spotlight that is on them. Juliet runs off the opposite direction of Karen and starts looking for Iris and is followed by Shawn and Gus. Gus starts off in a different direction and Shawn follows. Gus says he is trying to find a way outside to get to the lighthouse to signal for help. He pushes various buttons on the wall, one of which seems to open a big metal door. Once the door opens, the BGN walks out and politely shakes hands with Shawn and Gus commenting that he will be dismantling them shortly. BGN then pulls out a sword.Juliet walks into a room where Allison is. Allison comments that Juliet still has no ring on her finger. Juliet ponders aloud why everyone keeps saying that and then the two women start to fight. Henry and Woody are walking down a hallway. As they reach an opening, Heather punches Woody in the nose. Henry starts talking to her but is cut off by Heather grabbing him, kneeing him, and throwing him to the ground. Heather then starts attacking Henry and Woody in a kind of WWE style assault. Shawn and Gus are backing up in a cell block amazed as BGN does fancy moves with the sword. Karen finds Iris locked in a jail cell with her hands tied behind her back and her mouth duct taped. There is a note hanging inside the cell that says "What about the key?." Karen tells Iris not to worry and goes off looking for the key.Shawn and Gus are still backing up and talking as BGN continues. Gus comments how he shouldn't have rejected Selene, and Shawn comments how he shouldn't let the ring missing hinder his life with Juliet. Then BGN stops as he is ready to fight. Shawn and Gus scream and run away. Juliet and Allison continue fighting. Juliet notices a shotgun hanging up on the wall. As she tries to go for it, Allison stops her and throws her into a glass table. Woody is laying under a table. Henry is laying on top of the table. Heather is standing on another table nearby and readies to jump onto the two men. As she prepares to jump, Henry takes the scarf from around his neck and swings it like a whip around Heather's leg. Henry pulls the scarf causing Heather to fall back off of the table. Henry picks up a folded chair and hits Heather with it twice. Then Karen walks in, picks up a folded chair, and hits Heather knocking her unconscious.While Juliet lays on the ground recovering from going through the glass table, Allison starts talking about everything they have in common except one thing as she gets the shotgun off the wall. Juliet points out that Allison is a sociopath who doesn't feel empathy, and Allison agrees that was the one thing. Juliet starts talking about another difference and then goes into a long speech about how she supports Shawn including his office location, his weird name for the business, his designing the office to replicate Gremlins, etc. Juliet says the point of it all is there is a martial arts gym next door to the office where she learned what a "kip-up" (a martial arts move where a person transitions from a laying down position to a stand up position) is. Juliet then kicks Allison and does a kip-up to get to her feet quickly. Juliet then hits Allison again and throws Allison onto the ground while also taking the shotgun from her. Allison then does a kip-up but is immediately hit in the head with the shotgun by Juliet. Karen then comes in saying they need a key. Juliet signals for her to search Allison who is laying on the ground unconscious. Karen does and finds a key ring full of keys. Karen then runs out of the room back toward Iris.Shawn and Gus run into a hallway where they see Henry with BGN behind him holding a garrote around Henry's neck. Shawn comments to Gus "Gus as a table." Gus comments that it never works, but Shawn says it did work once. Gus then turns around and runs out of the room. Karen and Juliet run to the cell Iris is locked in. Juliet warns Karen not to unlock the door yet as Allison warned about explosives. They look inside the door and see a bomb with a timer counting down. Karen tells Iris to try and move toward the back of the cell. Shawn saying silly things to distract BGN while Gus crawls in from a door behind BGN positioning himself on his hands and knees right behind BGN as a "table." Shawn gives Henry a hint about the table, so Henry elbows BGN and steps away as Shawn pushes BGN over the Gus table. BGN falls back over Gus gracefully landing on his feet perfectly and gets into a ready fighting position. Shawn and Gus comedically get into ready fighting positions of their own, but then Woody comes out from behind BGN and cocks a shotgun telling him to freeze. Henry walks over to Woody taking the shotgun from him as he is much more proficient with firearms as a retired cop.Back at Iris' cell, the bomb timer is down to 27 seconds. Karen tells Juliet to run away to safety, but she doesn't. Iris finally manages to pull her hands free of the rope they were tied with and pulls the duct tape off of her mouth. Now finally able to talk, Iris tells Karen not to pull the wire. Iris goes on to say there's a code to disarm the bomb, and the code is the date Allison got arrested. After a second, Juliet gets excited remembering the date and punches in the code disarming the bomb with 5 seconds left. Karen asks why Juliet remembers the date, and Juliet says it was kind of a big night for her. Karen unlocks the cell and runs in to hug Iris just as Shawn, Gus, Henry, and Woody arrive outside the cell.They arrive back at the harbor. Henry says he's going to leave as he has a unicycling class that starts soon, but then Henry says screw it and that he is going to go fishing. Selene runs up saying hi to Gus and gives him flowers. Gus hands Shawn the flowers and tells Selene the Fluffernutter sandwich she made him was the best one he's had in his life. He says he is open to dating, but she has to let him be the "cheetah" meaning the one to be more of the aggressor in the relationship. Selene says no problem then grabs Gus and starts kissing him. Gus points out that is not letting him be the cheetah, so she pretends to cower and Gus "pounces" on her.Someone calls Shawn's name. Shawn turns to see El Proveedor and his two henchmen approaching. El Proveedor tells Shawn all of Shawn's premonitions about his future came true. Gus is shocked and asks El Proveedor if he is being serious. El Proveedor says yes, and then a cut away scene starts. The first one shows Buzz McNab (Sage Brocklebank) dressed up posing as an IRS agent telling El Proveedor his tax issue has been resolved. Next McNab is dressed up as Santa Claus and stops El Proveedor from stepping into the street getting hit by a bus. Finally, McNab is dressed up in a different disguise at a restaurant sitting at the table next to El Proveedor. McNab asks to borrow the salt from El Proveedor's table but pretends to have a heart attack before getting it and advises them to heed the warning.El Proveedor says he appreciates Shawn's psychic gift, and in return, he has a gift for Shawn. El Proveedor reaches inside his jacket prompting Shawn and Gus to think he's about to pull out a gun. But instead, he pulls out a ring box. Juliet walks up next to Shawn as El Proveedor hands Shawn the ring box. Inside is the engagement ring that was stolen right after Shawn proposed to Juliet. Shawn and Juliet are in shock. Shawn thanks El Proveedor and says he's ready to get married. Shawn starts spouting out some crazy wedding ideas involving volcanoes and castles and other crazy things. Juliet says she doesn't need that or anything special and that she never has. She says they should just go to Vegas now and get married. El Proveedor interjects to let them know he's ordained and can marry them. Selene tries to step next to Juliet saying she can be the maid of honor, but Karen comes up behind telling her that is not going to happen. Gus starts crying, so Shawn tells him he needs Gus to pull it together so he can give his best man speech. BGN, who is handcuffed and being escorted by an officer, stops and offers them his sincerest congratulations. Shawn thanks him and comments "that's just a good dude." The camera pans out as El Proveedor starts the ceremony with the typical "Dearly beloved..."In the psychphrancisco office, Shawn is pretending to have his finger stuck in a glass fish mouth. Gus tells Shawn to stop goofing off and find his passport as Juliet and Selene are already at the airport checked in and waiting for them. Shawn finds it and then picks up a pineapple asking if he should slice it up for the road. Shawn is wearing a #TeamGrimmie shirt. Gus asks Shawn if he and Juliet are sure they are okay with Gus and Selene coming along on their honeymoon. Shawn says they are sure. They hear what sounds like gunshots outside. Gus asks if they should be worried, but Shawn says it's probably just firecrackers since they are in Chinatown. Just then, Juliet's brother, Ewan O'Hara (John Cena), comes down the steps and into their office. Holding a wrapped gift. Ewan congratulates Shawn for finally making a honest woman out of his sister. Gus worriedly asks what Ewan is doing there as Shawn and Gus know Ewan is or was a black ops operative for the government. Ewan says he is chilling as he closes the door and barricades the door with a big piece of metal. Ewan asks if there is a back door to the office and gives Shawn a wedding present. Ewan then asks if they have a Kevlar vest or lead shield he could borrow. Shawn says they are about to leave to go to the airport to go to Jamaica for his honeymoon. Ewan makes small talk commenting on the Gremlins design of the office while suspiciously looking outside the window. All of a sudden, a helicopter can be heard outside and a voice over a loud speaker telling Ewan to come out with his hands up. Ewan tells them not to worry as this is all about him. Then green rifle laser sights start shining through the front window. The voice over the loud speaker then says for "Shawn Spencer and associate" to come out as well. Ewan tells them they are now involved, and Gus angrily comments being referred to as "associate" as he pays the rent for the office. Ewan hurries them toward the back door. Ewan sees Shawn is not holding the present and tells Shawn he is going to need it. Ewan throws a tear gas grenade on the ground while Shawn runs back to grab the present. As Shawn gets the present and starts running back toward the office back door, the operatives outside the office start shooting into the office. Ewan warns Shawn not to break the case of the present or drop it as they run out the back door. Gus asks Ewan if the present if really a wedding gift, and Ewan tells Gus it's the thought that counts.
