              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> The day begins for several people related to the school. Patricia (Storm Reid) makes breakfast for her dad, Daniel Crawford (Common) who is an account manager at Field Publishing Company. She reminds him of the need to attend career day. Nerdy kid Darius Schneedy (Marcus Eckert) is facing his first day of school and is face timing a friend from where he used to live who tells him to go make new friends. Music teacher Christian McRow (Anders Holm) is woken in his car by his landlord who reminds him the rent is due. Principal Nichols (Allison Janney) is walking the track and utters an expletive when she discovered the body of a dead groundskeeper. The principal and vice principal Ned Pendlehorn (Rob Riggle) carry the body into the teachers' lounge. Daniel drops off his daughter at school and sees Christian smoking multiple cigarettes. Patricia reminds her dad of career day with a post it on the steering wheel. Rosa (Sonia Iris Lozada), the nanny, drops off Darius and tells him it's her last day. The school secretary identifies the dead groundskeeper is Kevin. They decide to close the teachers' lounge.Daniel gets a call in his car from Bob (Keanu Reeves), the spouse Nadine (Jennifer Garner), the woman with which he has been having an office affair. Bob wants to meet for lunch and threatens to perhaps kick his ass. When Danial arrives at the office, the kitchen area is marked off with police tape. Daniel tells Nadine about Bob's phone call. Nadine is upset and tries to blame the affair on Daniel. Daniel tells her about the lunch meeting and she insists he say nothing about their activities.At school, Darius glasses are stolen and he is knocked down by a Rufus (Michael Berthold), a known bully. Darius is helped up by Patricia. Christian confronts a boy he meets in the hallway going in the opposite direction. He teaches him to make a decision by choosing a direction, committing to it and moving ahead. At the publishing company, a coworker warns Daniel about the hazards of careered day. The new boss from corporate, Arthur Schneedy (Bradley Whitford), calls a staff meeting. Schneedy and head of security Melissa Brickman (Mary Birdsong) report that the coffee machine was sabotaged over the weekend and an inappropriate drawing with threatening language was left nearby. A thorough investigation begins immediately.Back at school, the paramedics (Katie Holmes and Ned Faxon) refuse to remove the dead body from the teacher's lounge and caution the principal and vice principal who moved it in the first place, that their act was illegal. Mindy (Maria Sokoloff), the school secretary tries to identify the body by calling the landscaping company. Ned can't believe there are four gardeners at the landscape company named Kevin and they still can't identify the corpse. In art class, Darius introduces himself, thanks Patricia for helping him that morning, and offers her a Rollo. Shop teacher Ramirez (John Cho) reports to Christian that a student shat his pants in class. Christian tells the shop teacher he has lost everything but is interrupted by the table saw going off in the shop teacher's class. Darius summons up the courage to ask Patricia to "go" with him but defers her answer until later in the day.Daniel's coworker theorizes that a Swiss army knife was used to cut the coffee machine cord because of her extensive viewing of NCIS. Daniel is called in for his security interview. At school, a very depressed Christian lectures his youngest students on failure. Daniel is interrogated and emphatically denies sabotaging the coffee machine. Immediately after, Daniel is to meet the new boss, Mr. Schneedy. Nadine gives a message to Daniel that he is now scheduled for coffee with Bob at 3:00p.m. Daniel struggles to provide Schneedy with any individual personal accomplishments at work. Finally, he points out that he writes the company newsletter, Daniel says the one interesting things about himself is that he plays acoustic guitar which Schneedy denies is interesting.At school Darius encourages Patricia to think about his proposition and lists his good qualities. At lunch break, Patricia rejects Darius's dating offer which depresses Darius. The coroner has not arrived and the deceased Kevin is not yet been identified with next of kin angry they have been contacted. Ned finds a lottery ticket on Kevin's body which only wins one free additional ticket. Ned tosses the ticket out the window.Schneedy summons Daniel to his office again. Daniel is confused why he is there and admits to having an affair with Nadine which ended that morning. Nadine however told security agent Brickman that it was Daniel who sabotaged the coffee machine. Schneedy fires Daniel. Nadine tries to apologize to Daniel but Aaron (Al Madrigal) keeps interrupting her until Daniel is escorted away.At school, Christian again encounters the boy he taught about making a decision. The child turns and scurries of in the opposite direction. Christian climbs to the roof of the building to contemplate his life. Daniel has reported to human resources and is consoled by Perry (Kumail Nanjiani). Daniel talks about forgetting what is wife looks like and getting involved with Nadine. Darius has a bathroom conference with Mr. Ramirez who confirms for Darius that if a man loses everything, he has nothing left. A despondent Darius joins Christian on the roof. Patricia tells Mrs. Arin (Monica Young), her teacher that Darius is missing from class. A living Kevin from the landscaping company calls and balls out Mindy for alerting his relatives of his demise.The parents start to arrive for today. Schneedy arrives and reports to the same room that Daniel is already in creating an awkward situation. On the roof, Darius and Christopher discuss crushed dreams. When given the opportunity to speak, Daniel admits he got fired that day and is no longer an account manager for Field Publishing. He takes questions from the class regarding the circumstances. Schneedy insists on going next and looks for Darius to introduce him. Christian asks Darius why he came up to the roof. Darius says that he had a rough day as the new kid and he is lonely.At career day, Schneedy describes his job and the situation he had to deal with that very day. Schneedy tells the class of Daniel's affair. Daniel responds by calling him a piece of shit. They go outside for a fight. Everyone follows them outside to see the fight. The principal and vice principal notice Christian seated on the roof ledge and tell Mindy to call 911. Darius talks about always having to move and being the new kid as his dad fights Daniel below. The same paramedics arrive and refuse to help, saying they don't do suicide cases.Darius tells Christian he doesn't think that he is a failure. Christian decides to come down with Darius, but trips goes over the edge. He lands in a big pile of dirt and finds the winning lottery ticket and finally feels like a winner. The paramedics help him. Darius tells his dad that he doesn't want to move anymore. Patricia scolds her dad that she should have known before her class that he was fired. Patricia introduces her new friend Darius to Daniel.Bob meets Daniel downtown. Bob takes Daniel to the bathroom of a coffee shop. He wants to compare himself to Daniel. He demands he expose his cock. Daniel is reluctant and Bob takes this as a sign Daniel has a tiny penis. Bob gives Daniel and Indian burn as he departs. The sun begins to set. Daniel feels a sense of relief and tell his daughter that everything is going to be okay. The coroner finally arrives and the body is removed from the teachers' lounge</p>
