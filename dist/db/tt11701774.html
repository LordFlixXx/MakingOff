              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> After meeting with her agent Rob, self-help author May Ryer hears a distant scream in a parking garage. May gets into her car anyway, and drives home to her husband Ted.May rouses Ted during the night after she sees a masked man stalking outside their house. May becomes confused when Ted nonchalantly identifies the stalker as the same man who tries to kill them every night. Ted calmly tells May they now have to fight for their lives.The masked man attacks May. Ted rescues May, but the man disappears. Ted recounts what happened as though bored when Officer Mercy comes to the house to take a police statement.The next morning, May asks Ted to explain what is happening. May's confusion sparks an argument. Rather than fight, Ted drives away alone.The masked man returns that night. May fights him off and he vanishes again. Officer Pace comes to take May's statement. Officer Pace oddly steers his questioning to discuss a domestic dispute between May and her husband.With Ted not returning her calls, May looks for him at her sister-in-law Sarah's house. Sarah appears only mildly concerned about the repeated home invasions as she explains Ted went to stay with their parents. Sarah also refers vaguely to a previous fight between May and Ted.May attends a reading and signing for her latest book 'Go It Alone.' May notices her assistant Edie arriving late again. Distracted, May has difficulty answering audience questions. On her way home, May stops at a hardware store to buy supplies for fighting her attacker.The masked man attacks a third time. May fights him off and he disappears once again. While taking her statement, Officer Pace tells May she is lucky.The masked man attacks three more times. Even though May stabs him in his throat, the man still disappears before May can restrain him. The police continue to be of little help.May's agent Rob visits. Rob tells May she is lucky that her publisher wants another book. May defiantly contends that she is a hard worker, not lucky.A state-appointed social worker comes to interview May. May says she suspects something supernatural could be happening as she explains she doesn't feel like she lives in a world she understands anymore. May also reveals she cheated on Ted, which caused a rift in their relationship. May still has to insist to the counselor that the danger comes from the home invader, not from her husband.May goes to stay at Sarah's. May asks about a strange scar on Sarah's back, but Sarah catatonically dodges the question.The masked man breaks in that night and attacks Sarah. May splits open the man's head with a hammer before collapsing on the ground beside him.A paramedic helps May recover. The paramedic reveals Sarah went to the hospital and her son Cooper is safe. The medic strangely insists that May follow his specific instructions.While the medic treats May, Officer Pace questions her about the attack. May becomes further confused when Pace mentions that this has been happening to her ever since the parking garage.May becomes overwhelmed by authorities, medics, and social workers asking overlapping questions. May escapes out to her car and is suddenly transported back to the parking garage.May rescues her assistant Edie when she sees Edie being attacked by another man in the garage. May and Edie discover they are both reliving these attacks every day.May and Edie run past more men attacking other women. Edie proposes working together to stop the attackers. May contends that they can't help everyone. May further insists that there is no rationalizing what is happening either.The masked man kills Edie. May ignores pleas from the other women as she runs for her life. May gets away in her car.Ted suddenly appears in the backseat. May is immediately wary of her husband as she realizes they are now outside their house.May and Ted discuss the divide between them. May says she thought she was being punished for infidelity, but after seeing other women experiencing similar assaults, she realized that wasn't true. May says she understands she isn't a bad person.May asks Ted who the masked man is. Ted responds that it doesn't matter because it is simply the way things are. May suggests going inside the house even though Ted reminds her it isn't safe for them in there.May tells Ted she wants to give up but knows she has to continue going it alone. May and Ted embrace. The masked man suddenly stabs Ted to death from behind.May locks herself inside the house. The man produces keys to get inside, which May tells him isn't fair. After asserting that she doesn't deserve what is happening, May stabs the man and they collapse together on the floor again. This time, May removes the man's mask. The man's morphing face cycles through all of the men encountered throughout her ordeal, including Ted. May angrily stabs at the man again. (copied from culturecrypt)</p>
