              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Iconic ballerina Misty Copeland made history when she became the first African-American woman to be named principal dancer of the legendary American Ballet Theatre in 2015. Copeland provides a behind the scenes tour of the American Ballet Theatre studios. She claims she is a perfectionist even to the point of having a preferred spot in the room in which she takes classes.The American ballet theater was founded in an effort to have an American presence in the international ballet theater world that would rival the Russians and French. The company performs at the New York City Metropolitan Opera House which is considered the most important stage in the world.Born in Kansas City, and raised in San Pedro, California, Misty Copeland did not begin studying ballet until the relatively late age of 13. By age 15, she was one of the top ballet prospects in California and won the prestigious Spotlight Awards. At 17 she moved to New York to join the American Ballet theatre's studio company. The following year became a member of ABT's Corps de Ballet. Before she started with the studio company, she was allowed to go on a two week trip to China with the main company. There she met Leyla Fayyaz who became her best friend. They enjoyed trips to the Red Lobster. Not much later, she needed to lose weight, a challenge she wasn't sure how to handle. Being the only African American woman in a group of 80, she felt alone and ate Krispy Kreme donuts to sooth her sadness.Susan Fales-Hill served as a mentor and introduced her to women who had blazed trails as firsts in different fields to give her role models for the future in an atmosphere where the major ballet companies were being criticized for their lack of diversity. Classical ballet dancers have routinely been judged on their aesthetics. Pale skin color and a prepubescent body type are routinely not associated with women of color. Ballet as an art, has always sought assimilation and conformity. Misty changed her prospects when she developed a new found focus. She began to realize her being successful in ballet was bigger than just her as a dancer. She envisioned herself as a breakthrough role model for others to emulate who might pursue ballet.Misty Copeland danced the role of Gamzatti in La Bayadère. In 2013, she was offered the lead role in Igor Stravinsky's challenging Firebird, to be performed at New York's Metropolitan Opera House, a major coup for a soloist. The crowd at the Metropolitan Opera House changed. Her mentor invited many African American women of achievement to share Misty's triumph. Misty admitted at a gathering following a night of the performance that she was in pain having had fractures in her shins. She pushed the pain aside to have a successful season of the Met not knowing if such an opportunity would ever come again. Pain is being part of being a ballet dancer and pain tolerance develops to high degrees in dances. After Firebird in the fall of 2012, Misty had major surgery on her left shin. Few were optimistic she would be able to resume her career where she had left off.Misty rehabilitates learning floor barre from Marjorie Liebert. Before returning to the American Ballet Theatre, Misty performed the Dying Swan with Michele Wiles and her Ballet Next Company to test her leg and gain confidence. Her self-assessment was that she performed adequately, and didn't fall but didn't use the space well.The next day, Raven Wilkinson, the first African American to dance in a major ballet company, visits Misty in her apartment. Misty discusses that when she finally discovered Mary Wilkinson's career in a movie, she cried. The women laugh together reenacting the same part they had both performed in Swan Lake.When Misty returns to the American Ballet Company, she perform in the Robert Bolle and Friends International Tour. She struggled with nagging injuries throughout. In Italy, Misty is seen getting a chiropractic treatment for back spasms. Before the show, she applies make up and gets a costume fitting. She performs with Jared Matthews. The tour continues despite her continued soreness from surgery, but her to return has been triumphant.Gilda Squire, Misty's manager says that even though Misty's aim is to be the principal dancer of the American Ballet Theatre. she has already won. Copeland possesses world fame and a growing fan base that follows her career. Misty is seen doing an Under Armour photo shoot. Copeland's goal is to bring people of all backgrounds into the ballet. When a larger than life billboard is revealed, Misty and friends drink champagne.In the summer of 2014, Misty is cast in the lead of Swan Lake making her the first black women to dance the role of as Odette/Odile in an elite international ballet company. In September 2014, rehearsals and performances take place in Brisbane, Australia. On June 30, 2015, Misty Copeland was named the principal dancer at the American Ballet Theater Company proving dreams do come true.</p>
