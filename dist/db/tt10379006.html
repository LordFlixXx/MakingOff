Tennie although very academically inclined and mature for her age, with compassion for others, has got a touch of sarcasm, and a hint of rebelliousness in her. Tennie just broke up with her boyfriend, Jason Bourne (Shea Foster). Seeking revenge, Jason spreads the rumor that he and Tennie had sex and she was not very good at it. To further complicate the daily rigors of teenage life, her father, Robert Grigorian, (Vahik Pirhamzei), an Armenian born advertising executive who has since rebuilt his business, tries to do the same with his relationship with his daughter. Meanwhile, Robert is being stalked by Jenny (Whitney Ann Jenkins), a woman Robert got acquainted with through a real estate deal and has begun to think of herself as Robert's girlfriend. They all live in Glendale, California.
Her father gets his license suspended because of his drinking and must hire a driver. He is pressured to hire his assistant Daniella's (Mariam Meliksetyan) cousin Jack (Angelo Diona), a 19-year old aspiring actor as his driver for two weeks. They pick up Tennie to show her their new house, which is only one block away from their old house. Tennie is unimpressed. Robert swears Jack to a confidentiality agreement and warns him to stay away from Tennie. Jenny wants Robert to introduce her to Tennie. Robert also learns that Jenny has been seeing a therapist for 14 years. and suggest a family counselor for Robert and Tennie to bring them closer.

She also claims she is closer to her Aunt Melanie (Anahid Avanesian), as they prepare to go to a screening of a new movie. Robert seeks out his sister to learn about Tennie's concerns but other than telling him Tennie is angry, she is uncooperative. The next morning. Robert is playing music and preparing breakfast in the kitchen which is odd behavior. Tennie declines breakfast and hurries out the door.
