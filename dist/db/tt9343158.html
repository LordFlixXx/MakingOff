              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Megan, her husband, and son are on a road trip to a lake in the woods and get into a horrible accident because she is a negligent driver. (She is swerving all over the road.) Her husband and son died in the crash, Megan survived.Four years later, Megan is talking to her therapist, Dr. Landford, played by Lifetime MVP Lindsay Harley. Megan is in a mental institution being paid for by her parent's inheritance. She decides she is getting out of there and gets some meds and a meaningful necklace then heads to Gary's (Her brother) house. Gary doesn't answer her calls and isn't at the house on the hill, so Megan breaks in.Megan wanders through the house and hears voices. She finds a note to Gary from someone named Lisa and is happy that he has someone. Eventually, she falls asleep and awakens, disoriented and confused.At the town diner, Megan asks Lisa if she has seen Gary. Lisa doesn't know who Gary is and has been married to another man for three years. Megan goes to the police to file a missing person report. The problem is, Sheriff Brunson doesn't remember or recognize Gary either. Next, Megan goes to see long-time family friends and neighbors who don't remember Gary either.When Megan goes back to Gary's house, it is empty, and his phone number has been disconnected. She has a full-on meltdown. While drinking some water and downing a handful of pills, Megan gets a phone call. On the other line are car horns and crashing sounds.Megan goes to the town bar and stuck up a conversation regarding his brother with the Bartender Duke. Duke is played by Rob Mayes. The scene happens, and he doesn't know Gary either.Megan goes to see her family lawyer, who tells her that she is the only heir to the family estate. Afterward, she goes back to Duke to tell him what she found out. He finds it weird that Gary never came up in the conversation and suspected that maybe Gary had a falling out with her parents. He also finds it strange when Megan claims to find a rattlesnake in her car. They report it to Sheriff Brunson, who is hostile and straight-up rude. He accuses them of being drunk assholes.On the beach by the house, Megan opens up to Duke about her tragic accident and time in a treatment facility. Duke is supportive and understanding. They snuggle on the couch, and later sneaks away to the bathroom where he see her medication pills. Then he takes her to the high school to find Gary's yearbook and bingo, they do. Megan knows she isn't crazy now. Dean is happy she isn't insane, too, so he kisses her in the car.When Megan brings the yearbook to Sheriff Brunson, he is even more of a dick. Megan and Duke will have to do their detective work without him.Megan finds someone who saw Gary a few days ago. The woman's name is Miss Snow and was a high school teacher of Gary's. After Megan leaves Miss Snow's house, someone in a black hoodies murders her. Sheriff Brunson brings Megan in for questioning. He gets Megan to question if she can trust Duke.Parts of the puzzle start to fall into place. Megan is convinced that the neighbors, Sheriff, and lawyer all are plotting together because they killed Gary for money. Duke is not so sure. He drinks wine and listens.In the middle of the night, Megan hears a noise downstairs. She tiptoes downstairs. Duke puts a shirt and follows her downstairs which startles her. The next morning when she wakes up, Duke is gone.Megan goes to the bar and meets the owner who tells Megan that Duke lives in an RV and has been planning to buy the bar from her as soon as he secured a loan, but to-date he has not being able to do so and that she is firing him for not showing up for work.In the RV, Megan finds an obituary notice of her parents in Duke's computer and something about her therapist from the beginning of the movie. She also finds Gary's body in the bathroom. Megan calls 911 as Duke comes up to the RV. She grabs a pair of scissors and defends herself from Gary's killer. Duke tries to calm her down and denies everything.Sheriff Brunson arrives on the scene and shoots Duke in the shoulder and then beats him up a bit. As he is doing so, Sheriff Brunson says his villain monologue while waving the gun around. Megan knocks the gun out of his hands while he's going to shoot Duke dead, collects the gun and shoots the Sheriff in the heart.Megan and Duke kiss in the RV as she tends to his wounds and gives him hope hinting she will secure his loan and will give him a proper place to live.
