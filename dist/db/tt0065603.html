              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> At the home of the Escodero family, a lively social dance is taking place, with Don Enrique Escodero residing over the festivities. Dancing among the couples are his son Eduardo and his girlfriend, Christine. Don Enrique's other child, Leonore, is out in the gardens speaking with her boyfriend, Daniel. However, the tender moment is spoiled when an unearthly howling sound is heard from a nearby wall. Leonore surmises that the sound is coming from the vicinity of what would be her Father's room. As she and Daniel rush inside to her Father's room, they watch as he grasps a dresser and collapses to the floor.Don Enrique is then placed in bed, and sends for the administrator of his will. The elder Escodero requests that upon his death, the family home be burned to the ground. This request catches his children off-guard, and Eduardo is the most upset, soon after demanding why their Father changed his will, denying them the family home. Don Enrique also rouses the ire of his daughter Leonore, when he denies her request to marry Daniel.Don Enrique, with his servant, then reveals a secret entrance behind a dresser and portrait of his late wife. In a hidden stone room, lies a coffin, wherein lies the corpse of Eduardo and Leonore's Mother, Consuelo. Don Enrique then reveals that due to a curse and dark powers, his wife's body has been re-animated into that of a blood-thirsty vampire. Shortly afterward, Leonore is made aware of the curse, and her Father explains that he denied her request to marry Daniel because of this, afraid that she too would share her Mother's fate. Fearing this herself, Leonore returns a ring Daniel gave her, and requests that he not call on her again. Daniel is confused at this request, but Leonore will not tell him more.Shortly afterward, Eduardo sneaks into the stone room, hoping that his Mother's corpse will not attack him. Upon removing a crucifix from his neck, his hopes are proven false as she bites him, and shortly thereafter, he becomes a vampire. Running off outside, he finds Christina, and bites and attacks her.Christina (who is also the sister of Daniel) is taken home, but refuses to tell who attacked her. Shortly thereafter, Eduardo shows up, saying he had heard of the attack, and hoped to marry Christina. She consents, but Daniel is suspicious that it was Eduardo who attacked his sister. Both Eduardo and Christina are married, and later that evening, Eduardo casts his dark powers over her, claiming her as his own.Later on that evening, Consuelo escapes. After attempting to bite Leonore, Don Enrique and his servant chase her outside. Don Enrique tries to reason with his wife, but she keeps attempting to attack him, until the servant drives a stake through her heart. Don Enrique and his servant then burn Consuelo's body. Upon returning to the house, Don Enrique finds that Eduardo is now a vampire, and dies from the shock.After Don Enrique is buried, his administrator reads from the will, noting again the condition that the house be burnt to the ground upon his death...a condition that Eduardo refuses to adhere to. Storming out of the room and outside...where he meets up with Daniel, who has come to fight Eduardo, confident that it was him who attacked his sister Christine. Daniel and Eduardo fight, before Leonore appears, and calls for them to stop. It is then that she reveals to Daniel about their family's curse, which he refuses to believe. Daniel promises to take Leonore away, and they use a carriage and horses from the Escodero estate. However, Eduardo has sabotaged the coach, and the cart ends up rolling down a cliff, badly hurting Daniel and Leonore.Leonore awakes soon after and is informed that Daniel is dead, to which she vehemently denies this. Calling out for him, Daniel's spirit appears to her, and is also seen by Eduardo. Shortly thereafter, Eduardo turns her and 3 of the female servants into vampires as well.Knowing of what has been happening, Don Enrique's servant alerts the local priest and the villagers, who say prayers and chant outside the estate, as it is finally burnt to the ground, killing Eduardo, Christine, and the servants.Leonore manages to survive, as Daniel's spirit stabs her in the heart, and she dies, but lives on in spirit along with Daniel.</p>
