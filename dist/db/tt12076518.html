              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> A blonde woman runs through the woods and is murdered by a man with an ax.Sandra makes pour-over coffee for her sister Becky and is very prepared for all situations. (She is a lawyer after all.) Sandra is going to her boyfriend Brant's cabin in the woods to meet his family. They have been dating, three months.Brant and Sandra drive up and talk about his family. They stop for gas, and Sandra pays the gas station attendant $5 to use the bathroom. He gives her flowers and is generally creepy. He asks where she is headed. They drive on and park the car, then hike to get to the cabin.When they arrive at the cabin, Sandra is disappointed to learn that there is no cell service. Sandra and Brent enjoy a campfire and drink some wine romantically.The romance doesn't last long, Sandra sees someone lurking in the woods in the middle of the night. The next morning, Brant takes Sandra foraging and shares all his nature knowledge. Then, they make out hardcore in nature. While they are hooking up, someone steals Sandra's backpack. It has all her clothes, cellphone, and wallet inside. The car keys are also inside. Brant laughs it off and blames marmots. Sandra frantically searches for her backpack and injures her foot. They are stranded, and Brant seems totally cool with it. He promises to leave if things get weird.For starters, Brant gives Sandra his dead mother's clothing and takes her ax throwing and makes her cook trout. Sandra almost puts poisonous mushrooms in the dinner, but Brant stops her. They eat by the campfire, and Sandra heads upstairs to put on some sexy red lingerie while Brant puts out the fire. When he doesn't come to bed, Sandra heads downstairs and looks outside. She sees someone in the woods and runs from them, directly into a tree.When Sandra comes to, she meets Brant's father, Langley. Langley says that Sandra is perfect and will do much better than the last girl. Langley tells Sandra about all the girls he and his son have captured and how they died. None of them could live up to the role of the woman of the household. He chains her up and expects her to be his house servant. (Cooking, cleaning, and household duties.) Langley suggests Sandra sleep with him.The men talk as if Sandra isn't even there. Brant talks about how easy it was to lure Sandra with online dating. Langley is impressed with his son and tells him he did a good job this time.Sandra attempts to free herself from her chains while the men are fishing. She almost sneaks out but overhears the men talking about Brant's mother trying to escape and Langley murdering her.Brent lets Sandra go for a walk with him. It isn't as romantic as before. Brent tells Sandra that he and his father "share" women. Langley catches them and punches his son in the face. Then he locks Sandra in the outhouse.Sandra decides to play along and suggests fixing fish for Langley, and he allows her to go in the forest to pick what she needs. She, of course, remembers the poisonous mushrooms. When the father and son ask if Sandra is eating, she says she has a headache. Just as they are about to dig in, there is a knock at the door. It is Carl, the man from the gas station.Carl can tell that something is wrong and sits down to join them for dinner while taking in his surroundings. He scarfs down the fish while telling them that Becky has been looking for her sister. The poison effects Carl and Brant. Langley knows better and doesn't eat the fish. Carl stabs Langley, allowing Sandra to make a run for it.Becca finds her sister in the woods and tries to save her. They both end up tied up and gagged. Langley was about to murder Sandra and keep Becky instead. But Brant intervene and tells Langley that he would take care of Sandra and taxes the ax from Langley and leads Sandra away. Brant admits to stealing the backpack and tells Sandra that she reminds him of his mother as he kisses her. He then tries to kill her with the ax but suddenly double over and Sandra hits him in the head with a rock, multiple times, and takes his ax to free herself.Sandra comes back to the cabin and creeps behind Langley and tries to ax him, but she gets over powered. As he was about to kill Sandra again, Sandra tries to save Becky by offering herself to Langley. She distracts him by talking about his dead wife, Elizabeth. This allows Becky to knock him with a log. Sandra kills Langley with the ax. Brant comes back and almost shoot Becky. Sandra uses her ax-throwing skills to kill him.The sisters are lost in the wood until they get cell service and are saved. They find a Diner and orders coffee and pancake and would call the police since cellular signals are now restored. (thanks to lifetimeuncorked)</p>
