              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> FINDING JACK CHARLTON is the compelling, emotional and definitive portrait of a football life like no other. It is the story of an extraordinary man: an English World Cup winning legend, who became an Irish hero.The documentary charts Jack Charlton's special relationship with Ireland, impacting far beyond football to become one of only eight Honorary Irish Citizens. It examines his difficult relationship with England, his tragic estrangement from his brother Sir Bobby Charlton, and his final battle with a fading memory.Directed by Gabriel Clarke (Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager; Steve McQueen: The Man & Le Mans) and Pete Thomas (Adam Hills: Take His Legs), the documentary features unique access to Jack Charlton, filmed during the last 18 months of the late sporting hero's life, with contributions from Jack's family for the first time including his wife Pat and son John. They are supported by key characters from throughout Jack's career, with major figures in football, music, film and politics, including Larry Mullen Jr. of U2, author Roddy Doyle, Brendan O'Carroll (Mrs. Brown) of Mr. Brown's boys, Paul McGrath, Niall Quinn, Mick McCarthy, David O'Leary and Andy Townsend.Contemporary filming and interviews combine with a wealth of unseen audio, visual and personal archive material enabling the exploration of the major pillars of Jack's life: Jack & England, Jack & Ireland, and Jack and his brother, Sir Bobby Charlton, as well detailing Jack's previously undocumented life with dementia. Significantly, Jack's family have given access to detailed, hand-written notes that Jack made and kept safe throughout his career. These game plans, tactical analysis, player reports, speech cards and personal notes take us inside the mind and thoughts of Jack again and offer a new level of understanding into 'Finding Jack'.Jack Charlton won the World Cup in 1966 playing alongside his brother, Bobby, in England's greatest ever side. A hugely proud Englishman, Jack applied for only one job in his subsequent career as a football manager: the England manager's job. Jack never received a reply from the FA. Instead, Jack Charlton accepted an invitation to manage the Republic of Ireland, and took a side that had never qualified for a major tournament to the dizzying heights of a World Cup quarter final. In doing so he inspired a nation. Victories over England at the 1988 European Championship, Romania at Italia 90 and Italy at the 1994 World Cup represented more than just football success for Ireland and influenced a social and cultural change in a country that faced deep-seated political and economic challenges.World Cup winners in the same England team in 1966, Jack Charlton and Bobby Charlton were the most famous footballing brothers on the planet. Very different men and personalities, they fell out during Jack's time as Ireland manager and were estranged for more than two decades. Jack Charlton's Ireland team would never lose to England, but for all his international success and growing stature off the field Jack was never knighted, unlike his brother. Jack's relationship with his brother is a hugely complex feature of his life, with an incredible peak and ultimately tragic conclusion.Finally, the film also details Jack's previously undocumented life with dementia. This contemporary narrative forms a central theme of the story, offering an intimate, compelling insight into Jack the man and the challenge faced by thousands of families universally.</p>
