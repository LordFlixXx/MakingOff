Keren uses her hoodie to create a distraction while Todd, who is additionally suffering from a slug lodged in his arm, unsuccessfully attempts to put the SUV in neutral so it can be moved for rolling cover. Eric uses a video shot from his cellphone camera to determine the sniper's position.Todd retrieves a toolbox and duct tapes its medal lid to his arm for protection. Although he takes another shot in the process, Todd manages to get the SUV rolling on his second attempt. However, the SUV rolls in the opposite direction until the sniper shoots out another tire and disables it.Eric tries running toward nearby trees in the commotion.

The sniper shoots Eric through his hand when he tries taking a sip.During a quiet moment, Todd tells Jodi and Keren that his girlfriend Sarah was pregnant, but lost their baby.
