When Karan comes to know, he takes Adil for a night safari, shoots him & then leaves him for dead as he watches a leopard approach the injured Adil.Suchitra's father forces her to agree to the wedding, threatening that he would kill himself otherwise.
On the day of her wedding to Karan, Suchi escapes from the house (after receiving a message from Adil via Zeenat) & runs away on a bike with Adil, who is alive. Since Zeenat knows Adil does not love her, she slits her wrists in Suchitra's room after she leaves.
