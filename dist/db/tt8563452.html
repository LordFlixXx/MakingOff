              <p><strong>Ano:</strong> 2019</p>
              <p><strong>IMDb ID:</strong> tt8563452</p>
              <p><strong>Classificação:</strong> 5.2</p>
              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Demoted back to his hometown. A young Wall Street banker is drawn into investigating a tangled web of corruption and fraud in Upstate New York. Affecting both his personal life and business career.
Martin (Beau Knapp) works at OmniBank in NYC. He is a bit of a compliance geek which sometimes is not liked by his superiors Bernard (Sean Cullen), as it stops the bank from doing business with big firms, that fall foul of Martin's AML investigations. In one particular case, Martin's report says that the bank cannot deal with a company with $7 Billion in revenues. Martin is adamant that he saw money coming in and out of encrypted accounts, which does not establish source of income.
Martin's manager Robin fights for him and says that Martin was top of his class and had serious offers from Wall Street, which he passed to work at AML.
Due to his uncompromising behavior, Martin is shifted to a local OmniBank branch office, that happens to be in his hometown.Earl (Jeremie Harris) runs a local convenience store in town and is Martin's old friend. Earl also trades in bitcoin. He also mines bitcoin and trades them on open exchanges around the world.
Martin arrives at the OmniBank branch and is shown to his workstation. The previous AML officer Janice is already gone on leave, without any handover to Martin.
Caleb (Luke Hemsworth) is Martin's brother who lives in the hometown and is angry at Martin as he feels Martin ditched them when he moved to NYC 10 years ago.Katie (Alexis Bledel) works at a local art gallery that is under investigation as his first AML case at the new branch. Ted (Vincent Kartheiser) is the accountant for the company behind the art gallery and has links to some Russians. He is alarmed by Martin's investigations. Penelope (Malaya Rivera Drew) is the owner of the art gallery franchise. Katie tells Martin that Penelope is not the actual owner of the gallery and is more of a franchisee.
Penelope is having sex with Ted. Ted is alarmed to know that an AML officer came around asking questions, and it is also clear that Penelope is just a figurehead at the company.Martin also investigates the financial affairs of his family's farm and finds out that it is bankrupt and under foreclosure proceedings with OmniBank. Martin visits his father and advises him to bring on a silent partner or work with the bank to restructure the loan. But Martin Sr. is rude to Martin and asks him to leave.Meanwhile Martin is also worried about Earl's involvement in bitcoin and tries to talk him out of it. Martin finds that bitcoins are used primarily for drug trades, terrorism activities, human trafficking and so on.
Janice is the previous AML officer at the bank and is now battling cancer at home. Martin visits Janice at home, who is not able to remember much, but mentions that the art gallery is owned by a company called Carcasse. She is killed minutes after she speaks to Martin about the art gallery account and the exceptions approved for it in terms of AML requirements.
Earl shows Martin how OmniBank invested $10 MM in Crypto currencies just last quarter through a company called Merkel Investments. The seller was just a single entity called Carcasse Bait and Tackle based in Canada. This is same company that Janice said owned the art gallery.The man who killed Janice is shown to be keeping Martin under watch, and even visits Earl at his convenience store.
Martin meets Ted, who is the accountant of the gallery. Ted denies any knowledge of Carcasse.
Ted insults Martin by saying that Martin is trying to destroy the art gallery, which supports the town.
From Ted, Martin finds that his dad Martin Sr (Kurt Russell) was offered a 7-figure sum for the farm, which he refused. Martin confronts his dad about this, who reverts that Caleb had PTSD after his Iraq tour and the family needed the farm to keep itself together, which Martin left for a life in the city.
Earl, who is a hacker, figures out that Carcasse is using Omni Bank to launder money into the US using Bitcoin as medium. He is also threatened by someone who appears to have links with the Russian mafia to drop his snooping around.Penelope calls Martin to the art gallery and tells him that he is asking very uncomfortable questions. She tells Martin that she will probably be killed. She gives Martin a file with LT88 Petersburg written inside. Martin checks that this is a tugboat registered to Carcasse and is flagged by the US Govt for art trafficking.
That night Ted makes Katie OD on drugs, while Martin reports his findings to his boss in NYC, Robin Whitman (Jill Hennessy).Earl's liquor store was set on fire, and he dies in the blaze. Before that he had shipped all his belongings to Martin. In that was a USB drive with $3 MM worth of Martin's Crypto coins and all his research on Carcasse and evidence. Amongst the evidence were emails between Robin and Ted, while Martin's investigation was going on.Caleb informs Martin that their dad has been kidnapped with a note for all the evidence and material in Martin's possession. Martin and Caleb head to get their dad released. The FBI turns out just in time and Martin finds out that Katie was working for the FBI all along. Caleb saves Katies life from Russian mafia goons who were with Ted.
Based on Martin's evidence, Robin is arrested.</p>
