              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> A woman dressed as a nun in Halloween is swinging her daughter in a park. Then she starts observing a man who is in the park. Seconds later, visibly upset, she calls someone and says: get my gun and bring my car to the park. Her friend does as told, and then she parks at the other side of the fence in the park, where the man is sitting now. He approaches the fence as she starts to unload the trunk of her car with ropes and stuff. The man asks if she needs help, but she denies it. The man goes anyway outside the park ad starts helping her. At a given point, she goes to the car and takes the gun, forcing the man to enter the trunk. She takes him to an unknown place-she has the baby with her all the time-and then she attaches the rope to a big log. When the man is still in the trunk, she forces him to put the other side of the rope around his feet. Then she starts her car and the man falls to the floor when she advances slowly in the opposite direction. While the man is still in the floor, she points him with the gun. The man starts speaking that he has a wife and a son, to which she answers that "he has a wife and two kids."Chapter one starts with her in her house getting ready for work. When she arrives to work the next day, she is told that she has an apprentice as housekeeper. Then, Amanda-the lead-meets Rebecca and they get along pretty well since the beginning. They usually play pranks on each other. In the first one, Amanda takes off the sing of "Do not disturb". When Rebecca enters the room to clean up, a man goes to the door, and he asks her playfully if she wants to join to him and to another woman. Amanda and Rebecca end laughing in the corridor.In the next prank, it is Rebecca's turn. She adds an extra room for Amanda to clean and then takes the sing of "Do not disturb" as well. When Amanda enters the room, there is a man sitting in the front of the bed-the same man she attached to the log-and she excuses herself. The man says it does not matter because he was about to leave. He gets up from the bed, and he gets out of the room. Unknowingly to Amanda, the man has hid in the bathroom. When Amanda is not watching, he closes the door from inside, forces her to undress and then rape her and leaves her for dead.Chapter two begins when she is in the shower. When she gets out, she is visibly pregnant, and she is looking for work. She still often speaks with Rebecca. Mostly, about giving her baby in adoption. Finally, although she has doubts, she meets with Catherine, a mature woman who had no time for babies or family and that now has decided to make it on her own. Things go well for a while, she is wealthy, a Doctor and very kind to her. For example, once, she goes to a grocery store to buy food. When she is about to pay, the cashier tells her that she knows who Amanda is and that Catherine has an account open for all the spends she needs to make there. At the beginning, she is surprised, but in the end, it does not seem her that bad. The next time she meets with her, Catherine is at her front door waiting for her. She did not tell her her address, and the situation is starting to startle and disturb her a little. Things escalate when Catherine appears again at her front door, with Amanda's mail open in her hands. This time, Amanda says to her that she does not want her as an adopting mother to her child, and she tries to make her understand, in a very impolite way, that she needs to stay "the hell away" from her. Later, she makes a call to Catherine's office, and she learns that she is not even a Doctor.Amanda and Rebecca decide to go to a cabin in the woods that belongs to Rebecca. When they arrive, Rebecca must go to the car to search for more stuff. Amanda sits on a coach and starts eating chips. When it is clear that she has taken long enough to come back. Amanda goes out to look for her and finds her dead, apparently, in the floor. Then Catherine appears in the distance with a knife in her hand. They have a fight and finally Catherine enters the cabin. Amanda shoots her when she shows at the door of the room where she is waiting for her. She goes to the car to leave and starts moving Rebecca that is preventing her from getting the car to the road. At that moment Catherine, not dead yet, gets out of the house and starts following her. She runs away with the car passing over Rebecca's body, but at a given point the car has no more fuel, so she stops and starts running through the woods while Catherine is still following her, now with the gun. Amanda arrives to a sort of shed tool and hides there. Then she starts cutting her own belly. After seconds, she gets outside where Catherine is still waiting, and she tells her that she has killed the baby and that she can kill her if she wants given that she has nothing to lose anymore. She shoots her, but there are no more bullets, so Catherine hits her with the gun, and she falls down. Amanda takes a knife from the floor and stabs her, to finish her she takes a big log and smashes Catherine's head. At that moment, she approaches the shed tool and takes her baby. She practiced herself a Cesarean instead of killing the baby.Chapter three starts at the park, on the same scene with her swinging her baby. Everything is the same-even the apparition of Rebecca-who was apparently dead-until Amanda tells him about the two kids and a wife. At that moment she goes back to the car and leaves the gun, there she takes a rope and puts it around the neck of the man. She attaches the other part to the trunk, and she stars the car. Given the previous situation where she attached the man to the log, it is assumed that he will be decapitated because the rope on his neck, and the other one attached to the log preventing him from being dragged by the car. While the credits appear, she looks at the baby and drive the car away from the scene.</p>
