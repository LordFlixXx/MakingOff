              <p><strong>Ano:</strong> 2020</p>
              <p><strong>IMDb ID:</strong> tt9044298</p>
              <p><strong>Classificação:</strong> 3.6</p>
              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> "The presence, during the credits, of scenes from the Demeter, taken from Nosferatu, suggests that ship, though we will see that our vampire (Chelsea Tolle) is rather different - a different gender for a start and the vampire was brought on board before they set sail. More likely they are talking about the pleasure cruise ship whose crew we will meet soon.Before we get to that, however, we meet Captain McCloud (Mike Dooly) sat on a beach and smoking his special cigarettes. He puts the book Subferatu down and is approached by a butler (Jeremy Moller) with a new pineapple cocktail and a message that his ex-wife's attorney has called. McCloud offers a poetic image of them coming at night, red lips and white teeth - attorney's or ex-wives? Both, but mostly the latter - it is interesting that we get a flashback scene of him with Ellen, who we can assume is his now ex-wife, and she is played by Chelsea Tolle as well - conflating ex-wife and vampire. The rest of the story is his relaying of the tale.The crew are picked up by U-666 from the sea, though McCloud is miraculously dry. The crew are Ribbonclerk (Chris Bender), Atticus (John Gardner), Roosevelt (Thomas Nichols) and Scarlet (Claire Webber). They are somewhat taken aback by the antiquated rescue vessel and it becomes clear that they are from a contemporary (to us) time period. How has the U-Boat become unstuck in time? They were rescued within the Bermuda Triangle. Braunschweiger has a plan of sailing into New York harbour and surrendering.This would not seem to be Herr Gluhwein's plan (though he espouses it). He is the Renfield to the vampire and wishes to unleash her onto an unsuspecting America. The U-boat has such a small crew because of deaths on the trip - and it is noted that the surviving crew seem pale - and he had the Americans rescued to provide her with further snackage. There is the crew pretending to be what the German's think they are and - of course - the vampire attacks.We see her eyes, her in silhouette and as a silhouetted bat and it is as a bat that she attacks the first crew member, not a spoiler too far to say that it is Ribbonclerk. After this he looks sickly and then, when shot by Braunschweiger, he vamps out. The question is, who amongst the Germans can they trust and how will they prevent the vampire from making landfall. I have mentioned the primary lore and, in addition to her blood drinking and transformation we find out that there is a vampire killing kit on board - consisting of a stake, a cross and a note that says "Best of luck". The unique lore was McCloud's CBD oil acting like holy water and subduing the vampire."
