              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> He Xin had a wealthy family when he was a child, but on the third day of the Chinese Lunar New Year when he was twelve years old, his father and uncle failed to invest in foreign companies and went bankrupt. His father swallowed his largest shooting gunfire fight brutal suicide became father death burial corpse kill, leaving himself and his mother dependent on each other.One day, He Xin went to his mother's cousin's dentist's clinic for treatment, but because he couldn't pay the consultation fee, he was forced to extract two front teeth without anaesthetics. He Xin, who was suffering from severe pain and humiliation, swears to his mother angrily In the future, we will become rich and rich, and no longer be despised because of poverty toothache nightlife hysteria cry due to father death.Screen cuts to seventy years later since 1 January 1930 at lunchtime, Hong Kong Mandopop and Cantopop pop singers Andy Lau as He Xin became a physics college student with excellent grades, and even interacted with Cheng Le'er, a well-off university classmate. However, Fu Jiajun, son of tycoon Fu Laoqi, also liked Cheng Le'er, so Fu Jiajun extremely disliked He Xin, embarrassed him everywhere, and looked down upon him. He Xin came from a humble background, and the two have been in the same situation since college.When Hong Kong fell on Christmas Eve in 1941, He Xin was forced to suspend his studies and fled to Macau with his good brother Guo Yingnan (because there are many Japanese immigrants in Brazil , Japan does not want to offend the Portuguese government). The owner of the transportation company A Fangsu (who was also a good friend of Father Bai, He Xin's teacher when he was studying in Hong Kong) liked him, but he also had conflicts with Fu Laomai's culprit, Wang Chang. When He Xin and Guo Yingnan met in the casino, they had a pity with Nie Aotian, who was the director of the casino, and they were introduced to work for the casino owner Fu Laoji. He Xin came up with an idea to replace the material of the dice chassis, so that they have been winning by listening to the dice to distinguish the points in the casino recently. The three gamblers who had made a lot of money lost all their money.Once Wang Chang colluded with pirates in an attempt to use He Xin and Guo Yingnan to buy and sell drugs on the high seas to get rid of the two and betray the interests of the old man. He and Guo later exposed that the two had done a good job in safeguarding their interests and were rewarded as shareholders of the company. Wang Chang was forced to cut off a finger in order to ask for forgiveness. Therefore, the hatred between He, Guo and Wang became even greater.He Xin had a relationship with Dr. Afangsu's daughter Amei during the process of dating and teaching her literacy, so Amei was beaten by her half-sister Lucida, who also admired Hexin. Later, Hexin came forward and rescued Amei in time. Sister and marry with her. At this time, Fu Jiajun took his wife Cheng Leer back to work with his father, while Nie Aotian was transferred to work in Shanghai. Before he left, Nie Aotian was optimistic that He Xin could become a new generation of figures in Macau in the future. He sent Hexin a "forbearance" character to persuade him Tolerate everything in order to save your life, and you will have the opportunity to cooperate only when the time comes.For the sake of money and revenge, Wang Chang secretly instigated the robbers to kidnap Fu Laojie and cut off one ear of Laojie to ask Jia Jun to pay a ransom of 1 million Hong Kong dollars for his father. Wang Chang's Buffalo informed He and Guo that the mastermind was Wang Chang, and they went to rescue Lao Lao alone. Later, Wang Chang and Fu Jiajun, who led the police, arrived. Wang Chang took advantage of the situation to frame He and Guo as kidnapping Lao. The main suspect of the two were imprisoned. In prison, He Xin got malaria. Because the prison guards had been taken care of by Wang Chang, He Xin's relatives were completely unable to visit the prison. A-mei, who had no way out, had to ask Cheng Le'er to help He Xin who was in the middle of the night. Cheng Leer, who was still sentimental to He Xin, went to the cell to vaccinate He Xin.Later, He Yan came forward to dredge the relationship between the governor and allowed He and Guo to be released from prison. However, they were deported and banned from entering the country for ten years, so He, Guo and Amei left Macau and went to Hong Kong. During the years in Hong Kong, the two made a lot of money by investing in real estate . At this time, Nie Aotian, who had been separated for more than ten years, came to He Xin. Nie Aotian believed that the time was ripe and hoped to join forces with He Xin to return to Macau. Fu Jiajun also took over. Dad's career became the owner of the party. He, Guo and Nie established the Macau Entertainment Company in 1961 to fight against Fu Jiajun openly. Later, through various efforts against the Portuguese government, he defeated Fu Jiajun with a bid of 1.16 million to win Macau's gambling rights. He became the chairman of the company and slowly Towards the road of Macau's number one tycoon.Because Fu Jiajun lost to He Xin in business, and he heard from Wang Chang about the sex scandal that his wife Cheng Leer and He Xin were in prison, he sent someone to kill He Xin. He Xin was injured in an ambush by Fu Jiajun and others. A sister who was pregnant took the injured He Xin and fled to the basement of a church . Amei hid He Xin and faced Fu Jiajun alone. The embarrassed Fu Jiajun beats Amei for questioning. At He Xin's hiding place, A Mei was beaten to a coma. Later, Guo Yingnan sent someone to rescue him, and He Xin and his party forced Fu Jiajun to commit suicide on the spot.A-mei gave birth to her second daughter in the hospital, but was paralyzed due to injuries.

In the end, Wang Chang collapsed and went crazy after killing his wife and parents. He Xin came to the scene to see Wang Chang who went crazy and decided not to kill him. Instead, he wanted Wang Chang to be a dog and let others laugh and scold him. Be wary of those who oppose him.
