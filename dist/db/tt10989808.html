              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Aaron Beckman, a contract killer for a criminal organization called The Network, is ordered to kill his friend Hayes after he disobeyed The Network's orders despite having retired. With his dying breath, Hayes tells him that "There's no way out for us."Suffering from a gunshot wound, Beckman stumbles into a nearby church for shelter and offers his $350,000 in cash to the pastor, Philip. Philip treats Beckman's injuries and gives him shelter, taking only enough money to pay the church's expenses and burning the rest. Beckman, who is overwhelmed by guilt for a lifetime of violence, eventually prays to God at Philip's encouragement. When Philip dies of cancer, he asks Beckman to take over for him. Beckman has difficulty adjusting to his new life, still wracked by guilt, but that changes when a 17-year old girl named Tabitha, Philip's niece, appears on the church's front steps one night.Unwilling to talk about what has happened to her but clearly traumatized, Beckman adopts her as his own. One year later, Tabitha seems to have finally recovered, graduated from high school and on her way to college. However, her past violently reemerges when armed assailants, led by a man named Reese who appears to know her, abducts her as a helpless Beckman watches, unwittingly led there by another young parishioner named Tom. With little other recourse, Beckman contacts The Network and tracks down one of the assailants, Erik, based on a description given by Tom. Beckman tracks Erik down to a remote cabin in the desert, but after killing him and his cohorts, finds no sign of Tabitha. Using Erik's phone he calls Reese, who claims to have killed Tabitha and tells Beckman to back off. Meanwhile, Beckman is now indebted to The Network for calling on their assistance, obligated to carry out a single order from give him in the future.Using Erik's contact list, Beckman traces another of the assailants, Janice, to a house with her brother and husband. He holds them at gunpoint and forces them to drive him to Reese's location, but Janice manages to break free and cause a car crash, killing her brother in the process. She locks him captive in her basement with two other women and tortures him, but he manages to escape and kill her with another captive's help. Beckman attempts to lure in the third assailant, Frank, but he quickly realizes something is wrong when Janice doesn't answer her phone and leaves without entering.Beckman learns there is a $100,000 bounty on his head, and a $10,000 bounty on Tom. He rushes to Tom's apartment to find it empty, but is soon attacked by two other hitmen. He fends them off and manages to kill them just as Tom arrives, and quickly flees in a panic. Beckman catches up and tells him his life is in danger, and he reluctantly accompanies him. Beckman quickly realizes that they're being tailed by The Administrator, an infamous hitman with over 400 confirmed kills. They lure him into a nearby brewery and Beckman attempts to ambush him but fails, only being spared after he explains the situation to his would-be killer.Beckman takes Tom to a safehouse run by his friend Salvatore. Tom tries to talk Beckman down by reminding him of what he once preached, but Beckman pushes him away and leaves. With the help of a hacker, he manages to track down Frank to a restaurant he uses as a cover for a human trafficking ring. Beckman holds Frank at gunpoint and demands he give him Reese's location. He does, but Beckman then receives a call from The Network ordering him to cease any activity against Reese and his associates. Seeing the extent of Frank's victims, Beckman shoots him dead.Beckman drives to Reese's location at a remote ranch, where he is conducting a ritual to sacrifice his followers. He confronts him but Reese doesn't resist, telling Beckman he has no fear and asking him to shoot him. Remembering the words of Tom and Philip, Beckman refuses and leaves. Incensed, Reese insults Beckman and reveals that Tabitha is still alive and being held captive. Beckman finds her and frees her, and reunited the two leave.Meanwhile, The Administrator shoots and kills Reese and calls The Network, who order him to track down Beckman.</p>
