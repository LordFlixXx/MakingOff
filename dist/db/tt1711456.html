              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> In Texas, Jake decided to work while his wife Elizabeth and his kids went on a vacation trip. After a terrible car accident, only the black and white collie Cooper survived. The cop who found a veterinary hospital near Cooper's house didn't give enough information, so when no one responded when they called, they assumed he didn't care about the dog and, had there not been enough room, Cooper would have been put to sleep.In fact, Jake was so distraught over the loss of his family that he couldn't do much of anything for days. Janice finally got him to do something, and he finally showed up to pick up Cooper. Who wouldn't get in the vehicle. So Jake walked him home. And for reasons that make no sense, except for the fact that they allow Dr. Mason to be obsessed with Jake (while claiming to be obsessed with Cooper), Jake doesn't take the vehicle home. Instead, he comes to the vet's office day after day to train the dog to get in the vehicle. And the staff keep watching him.At first, Jake gave the impression he resented the dog for surviving when the rest of the family did not. In flashbacks, it is shown that the family found him and advertised hoping to find out who lost him. When no one claimed the dog, Cooper was theirs, though Jake didn't seem all that enthusiastic.Meanwhile, Dr. Mason has her own problems. Her mother has given up on life and only wants to drink. She is now in an assisted living facility with her gray and white cat. Could the dog eventually be helping her? Well, no. At least for now, the miracle dog is giving Jake a reason to live. And Jake, who didn't show up for work for the longest time, quits his job because he wants to do something else. He taught daughter Abby about photography and making videos Eventually he is shown at what must be Abby's school. A computer lab has Abby's name on it.So where does the movie's title come from? The dog was a desperately needed companion for Jake. But Dr. Mason still has her mother to deal with, and things aren't getting any better. And I get the impression she likes Jake, and vice versa. They have reasons to get together (for one thing, the dog does need a vet), and who knows? Meanwhile, what about the former owners of the dog? And what about the girl in the park who looks sick? Maybe this miracle dog will have other opportunities.</p>
