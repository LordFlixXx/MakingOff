A news bulletin reports on a satellite destroyed by an unidentified object over Canada.To celebrate Joe's 30th birthday, Matt and Jess take Matt's best friend Joe Mendez and Joe's girlfriend Liz Blackburn to a remote cabin in Gracefield, Quebec. Also joining everyone at the cabin, which is owned by Matt's Bigfoot-obsessed boss, is Jess' younger brother Trey Myers and Trey's girlfriend Julia Gilbert.On the first night at the cabin, a streaking light in the sky passes overhead. Matt and Joe investigate and recover a meteorite from a small crater in the ground. An alien creature tries grabbing at Matt, prompting both men to flee.Matt hears his dog Teddy howling in the distance. Trey takes the meteorite while Matt and Joe search a nearby cave for the dog. The alien creature grabs at Matt once more before chasing Matt and Joe back to the cabin.Trey tells the women that they saw something in the woods, but Matt and Joe refuse to get specific for fear of upsetting them. Because he does not want to risk running out of gas in the darkness, Matt suggests that they prepare to leave at daybreak.Matt has a serious conversation with Jess about his difficulty starting a family since the accident. Something hits a cabin window and leaves a strange pattern in the fractured glass.

An unseen force pulls Joe and Liz into the sky and they vanish.Matt and Jess review footage recorded earlier.
