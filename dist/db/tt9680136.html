              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> The story of a middle-class man who indulges in a light-heart affair with a project secretary in the middle of his stable and secure life with his wife.
Abhinav "Chintu" Tyagi (Kartik Aaryan) is a brilliant student in Kanpur who tops the PWD exams to get a govt job. His best friend is Fahim Rizvi (Aparshakti Khurana) with whom he shares his life. In response his father Arvind Tyagi (K. K. Raina) and mother Kusum Tyagi (Navni Parihar) arrange a match for him.
Chintu meets Vedika Tripathi (Bhumi Pednekar) and her parents Prem Tripathi (Rajesh Sharma) and Hemlata Tripathi (Geeta Agarwal Sharma). Vedika is quick witted and tells Chintu that she had an affair but will be dedicated to her marriage if Chintu has no issues with lack of virginity.They get married and before long its 3 years with Chintu's parents demanding a grandchild and Vedika demanding a transfer to Delhi as she finds Kanpur stifling. Chintu is bored of his monotonous life. He remembers his own old flame Neha Khanna (Kriti Sanon) whom he thinks was the only person who truly understood him but broke up only after dating for a month.
Meanwhile Vedika is a teacher in a local school and is fending off puppy love of a student Rakesh Yadav (Shubham Kumar).Enter Tapasya Singh (Ananya Panday) who is a leather exporter in Delhi and has come to Delhi to set up a manufacturing unit as her friend knows Chintu's boss in Kanpur in PWD. She gets referred to Chintu for all the legwork in setting up Tapasya's unit. It starts off innocently, but Chintu is enamored with simple things of Tapasya which remind him of puppy love again. He starts spending more with her taking her around Kanpur and even visiting all potential sites for setting up a unit.
Tapasya eventually finds out that Chintu is married and wants to meet his wife. Fahim advises Chintu against going any further with Tapasya. Chintu tells Tapasya that she can't meet Vedika as she is having an affair with Rakesh Yadav. He uses her "aww" to generate sympathy for himself and starts going out with her. He even tells lies at home to be with Tapasya in evenings.Meanwhile Rakesh Yadav is writing poetry letters to Vedika, and she counsels him to mend his spelling. But eventually Vedika gets suspicious of the stories made by Chintu and Fahim and catches Chintu and Tapasya red-handed enjoying at a bowling arcade. Vedika doesn't react, but quietly leaves Chintu without him even realizing. Chintu uses that opportunity to tour Delhi with Tapasya. He even stays at her house in Delhi.
Back at her parents' house, Vedika decides to hook up with her own ex Doga (Sunny Singh). That night both Vedika and Chintu have a chance to have sex with Doga and Tapasya respectively. But it is not clear if they did or not.Chintu comes back home when Vedika confronts him and asks him why he betrayed her. Vedika leaves Chintu with a stated intention to divorce him. Fahim convinces Chintu to go after Vedika to get her back. When they reach Lucknow, they learn from her parents that Vedika has left a note that she is leaving with Doga forever. Meanwhile Tapasya informs Chintu's parents that Vedika is having an affair with Rakesh Yadav.
Chintu admonishes Tapasya that she does not have any right to spread negativity about Vedika. Tapasya argues back that Chintu gave her the right when he told her his life's story. Chintu meets Rakesh and seeks his help to find Vedika.Rakesh reports back that Vedika has got a Canadian passport and is leaving Lucknow in 3 hours forever. Chintu reaches the airport with Fazim only to realize that Tapasya and Vedika had teamed up to make a fool out of Chintu. Vedika and Tapasya forgive Chintu as he never got physical with Tapasya, but Vedika reminds him that the smile on his face is only because of her. Doga leaves for Canada telling Chintu to preserve his marriage.
Chintu resumes work only to see Neha walk into his office.</p>
