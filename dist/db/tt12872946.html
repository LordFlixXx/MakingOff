              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> A high school jazz band embarks on a bus to California for an international band competition under the watchful band teacher, Mr. T. Friends Morgan, Maddy, and Jason have big plans to mingle and flirt with their foreign counterparts. Morgan harbors a secret crush on a beautiful, knockout blond named Yvette, but still has deep feelings for his good friend, Maddy, a piano player in the band. Unfortunately, their bus breaks down and they're forced to stay at a nearby motel for the night.A trio of girls, including Yvette, tease the boys by inviting them to an "orgy" in their room. Morgan and Jason are determined to go without really knowing anything about orgies. Mr.T confides in Morgan that he's set booby traps, paper door stops, to check if any kids sneak out of their rooms and asks for Morgan's help in enforcing the rules. But Jason and Morgan sneak out anyway and bump into Maddy who wants to come along despite the boys' protestations. The group decides to play "truth or dare", which gets steadily more sexual at the encouragement of Yvette's boyfriend, Wings. Maddy is able to cut through some of the tension with her silliness and volunteers to take the fall for the group by replacing all of their door booby traps except hers. Mr. T notices that Maddy left her room but let her off because she's such a responsible kid and her reason for leaving to get ice was not questioned.The following day, MR.T takes the group to a historical site while they wait for the bus to be repaired. But, despite Morgan and Mr. T's best efforts, the trip is a boring bust. At the behest of their classmates, Maddy convinces the female TOUR GUIDE to ask Mr. T out so if they're stranded for another night, they'll have the night to themselves. To everyone's amazement, the plan works, and everyone tells Morgan that he should be dating a great girl like Maddy.Morgan and Maddy wander off alone and talk about stargazing, a favorite pastime of Maddy's. The talk turns to Morgan and Jason's secret handshake, which Morgan confesses is from their favorite childhood show, "The Intergalactic Friendship Alliance." He explains that as kids, he and Jason would always go searching for the Friendship Pearl, a sign that Earth was worthy enough to join the Alliance. Maddy asks if he would like to look for the Friendship Pearl later that night with her telescope, and Morgan agrees.Meanwhile, Mr.T frantically attempts to get the band to their competition but becomes disheartened when they miss most of the events and decides to give up. He encourages the kids to "practice not giving a shit." Much to their disillusionment.That night, Morgan and Yvette end up at the hot tub together, where Yvette confesses her frustrations with Wings and their relationship. Maddy comes to find Morgan to go stargazing but he chooses to attend a "sexier" version of the night's previous party at Wing's behest, as Yvette seems to want his company. Much to Morgan's chagrin, Maddy joins as well. The party quickly devolves into hormone-fueled antics. Wings makes out with one of their classmates, Rebecca, despite Yvette's obvious displeasure. Morgan and Maddy partially undress in front of one another and, uncomfortable with the situation, Morgan kisses Yvette. Upset, Maddy leaves the party. Wings and Rebecca leave for the bathroom to continue their hookup, and Morgan tries to sleep with Yevette, but thinking of Maddy, he can't do it. Morgan confesses that he's a virgin and Yvette promises not to tell anyone.Returning to their room, Morgan is prodded by Jason to recount the night's events which leads to a fight: Morgan says Jason is immature and Jason says Morgan won't confide in him and share the details. Distressed Morgan ends up sleeping in a lounge chair by the pool. Mr. T comforts a tearful Maddy and tells her that sometimes action speak louder than intentions. This inspires him to call up his new tour-guide girlfriend and ask her to use her RV to get the kids to California.The next morning, Morgan is awoken to all the students getting rid of excess luggage so they can all fit inside her Winnebago to make it to the final event of the conference, The Goodbye Dance. In the process, Maddy leaves behind her treasured telescope. The group manages to make it to the competition just in time, though Morgan, Maddy, and Jason are still tense.When Wings makes some nasty comments about Morgan and Yvette, Morgan finally stands up for himself and challenges Wings to a fight on the beach. Though he gets in one good punch, Wings beats him up pretty badly before Mr. T intervenes. Maddy comes to check on him and Morgan apologizes before trying to kiss her. Maddy rebuffs his advances, saying she will only kiss if it's serious.
She leaves him alone on the beach where, after all these years, a groggy Morgan finally spots the Friendship Pearl and crawls to it and places his hand on it. The pearl explodes emitting a very bright white light. Returning very late to the dance, Morgan gets the DJ to play the theme song from Intergalactic Friendship Alliance and dances like a crazy man or should we say a nerdy crazy kid. He encourages Jason to join in and the two make up and dance like crazy. The entire class, except Wings, lets loose and have fun on the last night of their trip.Some time passes, and Morgan surprises Maddy at a wedding where she's playing background music on a piano. She is now in a relationship, though she confides to Morgan, that her boyfriend is not a great kisser. Morgan apologizes for the past and asks if they can try being friends again. Though Maddy no longer has her telescope, the movie ends with them gazing up at the stars up at the stars with their hands holding an invisible telescope.</p>
