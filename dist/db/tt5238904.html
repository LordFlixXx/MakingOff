The doubles then kill the original humans to acquire their memories and identities.Randy's clone comes to Josh's trailer trying to kill Randy. A horde of clones overturns the trailer with everyone inside. The horde pulls Josh away. Randy runs into the woods to draw the doubles to him so Zach and Kayla can escape.Zach and Kayla walk robotically to blend in with the clones as they make their way to Kayla's mother's store in town. While Zach retrieves a van key, Kayla becomes distracted when she sees her brother Joey being brought to a nearby fire station along with the rest of Multon's children.Kayla infiltrates a setup where replaced parents have creatures bite their children for cloning.
