              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Robin (Ben Freeman) and his friend Will Scarlett (James G. Nunn) have returned from the crusades and find their town being ruled by the tyrannical Sheriff (James Oliver Wheatley). The people are terrorized into pledging allegiance or be labeled as outlaws. Robin and Lady Marian (Marie Everett) gather a bunch of outlaws to the nearby Sherwood Forest to mount a rebellion.Sheriff declares war on Robin Hood and the entire rebellion. Robin wants to take a stand against the sheriff but is frustrated that the outlaws are not better trained. As the raids by the Sherriff get closer to the outlaws, they blame Robin for putting them and their families in harm's way. Robin is frustrated as while their ranks grow, but the outlaws are not able to defend themselves.
Robin's main troops include Little John (Jamie Kenna), Thomas (Kristian Nairn), Brom (Ryan Winsley) and so on.The Sherriff tortures the nearby villages to find who had been supplying grain to Robin Hood. He tortures the family responsible to learn Marian's location.
In one of the raids on Robin's hideouts, the Sheriff's troops manage to capture Maid Marian and a boy named Much (Charlie Hiett). Thomas is killed in the raids. Brom had collaborated with the Sherriff, but John stays loyal and doesn't reveal Robin's location even when held captive by Sherriff's men. Robin manages to rescue Brom and Little John by killing the men who stayed behind in the Forest to look for Robin.Now Robin has no option but to mount an attack on the Sheriff. John is not in favor of this confrontation, but Robin is adamant that Sherriff is using their allies against them, and so Robin's forces have to attack then and there.
Robin tells the women and children of his folk to hide in a cave and leaves instructions for them to find safety if he doesn't return by sunset of the following day.Robin infiltrates Sheriff's castle by donning the uniform of Sheriff's cousin Guy of Gisborne (James Groom), who had led the Sheriff's force into the Sherwood Forest. But while Robin leaves Guy behind, he forgets that Guy is still alive.Meanwhile the Sheriff wants to marry Marian to break Robin's resistance. Robin went with John, Will, and Brom. Upon entry, their weapons were taken for maintenance. Brom becomes their guide inside the stronghold. Brom tells Robin about the armory.
Robin tries to break into the armory to get weapons, when Guy returns to the castle and informs Sheriff that Robin is in the castle. Guy corners Robin in the armory, but meanwhile Marian manages to escape from the dungeons. Now Sheriff unleashes a brutal warrior named Brimstone (Martyn Ford), with clear instructions to capture Marian back.Robin and his men break into the armory but are trapped there as Sherriff's troops reach there before they can escape. They are pinned down with no escape path. The armory itself had training weapons, made of wood and are of no use in battle. Robin and his men bolt themselves inside the armory.
Robin & his men manage to escape a burning armory (set on fire by Guy) through a water passage that they find inside the armory. But Guy believes he is dead & tells Sheriff so. The Sherriff was getting impatient with Guy's repeated failures and soon receives word from guards outside the armory that they found no bodies inside it. Hence Robin has escaped and is alive.Guy comes across Marian and tells her that he killed Robin. Marian doesn't believe Guy and now knows that Robin is in the castle. She beats Guy and escapes.
Meanwhile, there are people inside the castle who support Robin in his quest against the Sherriff. Robin runs into many people inside the Stronghold and while most of them support the Sherriff, some support Robin by helping him navigate inside the Stronghold.Meanwhile Robin is on his way to the dungeons after arming himself at the main armory. But Sheriff concentrates his forces and along with Brimstone, finally manages to capture Robin and throw him over the castle ramparts into the ravine below. Robin miraculously escapes death and is attacked by Brimstone. But this time Robin manages to kill Brimstone and mount another stealth attack on the castle. Robin meets Friar Tuck (Brian Blessed) who tells Robin that he is fighting for a just cause, to defeat evil, and gives him a new sword to complete his mission.But now, Sheriff gets word on Marian's location in his castle and captures her, while killing Much. Robin first frees his men, who are under Guy's guard and then goes to rescue Marian. In a final confrontation, Robin kills the Sheriff and Marian kills Guy. Robin, and his men return to the Sherwood Forest to continue their fight against the corrupt crown.</p>
