              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> In 1984, Nandamuri Basava Ramatarakam asks Nandamuri Harikrishna for a photo album of her husband, N. T. Rama Rao, while he was younger. In 1947, Rama Rao works as a sub-registrar at Guntur sub-courts. He quits and decides to turn into a film star. For which his ideal companion, Basavaramatarakam and his loyal, affectionate brother Nandamuri Trivikrama Rao gives full-fledged support. Now Rama Rao reaches Madras, to meet the director L. V. Prasad who introduces him to the director B. A. Subba Rao and he is selected without an audition for the film Palletoori Pilla. On the set, he gets acquainted with star hero Akkineni Nageswara Rao, and both become good friends. Unfortunately, the movie gets delayed due to financial problems. Meanwhile, he is introduced in the movie Mana Desam as a cameo and also gets an opportunity in the Vijaya Productions banner on monthly wages who produce his first film Shavukaru which becomes a disaster. After that, Nagireddy & Alur Chakrapani plan another project Pathala Bhairavi when everybody suggests the name of Akkineni Nageswara Rao but director K. V. Reddy insists on Rama Rao as Thota Ramudu which becomes a blockbuster and establishes Rama Rao as the first Super Star on the Indian screen. Soon, he shifts his family to Madras.During that time, a severe drought affected the Rayalaseema region when Rama Rao unites several industry stalwarts and collects donations from the public because of which clashes arrive between Nagireddy & Rama Rao. Angered, Rama Rao leaves their production and starts his banner National Art Theatres introducing Trivikrama Rao as a producer associating with his brother-in-law Rukmanandha Rao. He also allows his friends T. Prakash Rao, D. Yoganand, and T. V. Raju. Afterward, Nagireddy & Chakrapani again approach Rama Rao and request him to come back and he agrees. While filming Mayabazar, everyone objects him to playing Lord Krishna's role, but he enthralls everyone with his divine attire. Later on, P. Pullaiah makes a devotional movie Sri Venkateswara Mahatyam there on-wards, people adore him as a deity, and devotees who visit Tirupathi complete their journey only after seeing Rama Rao.Time passes, Rama Rao couple is blessed with 8 sons & 4 daughters. At present, Rama Rao plans a project Seetharama Kalyanam in the role of Ravana, but no one comes forward to direct, so, he takes the project for which he toils in a steady position for 20 hours in a single shot. Thereafter, a tragic incident, when he is on the set of Irugu Porugu, his elder son Rama Krishna passes away. Yet, he withstands and completes the shoot, showing his dedication to movies. Years roll by, and Rama Rao & Nageswara Rao have been honored with Padma Shri by Govt of India where they are disdained as Madrasis by Prime minister Indira Gandhi when Rama Rao affirms that the pair belongs to Andhra Pradesh. Hereafter, Nageswara Rao shifts the Industry to Hyderabad but Rama Rao stays back to find a permanent solution for the recognition of the Telugu people. Eventually, Prime Minister declares a national emergency in the country when a lot of atrocities occur and Rama Rao turns against them. During the time of the '70s, Rama Rao decides to construct Ramakrishna Cine Studios in memory of his deceased son, when his career is at a low. So, he makes a prestigious project Daana Veera Soora Karna in his direction, playing 3 vital roles, taking care of the production department, and completing it within 38 days which becomes a huge blockbuster. After that, he grabs several hits, such as Adavi Ramudu, Yamagola, Vetagaadu etc.Then, Diviseema cyclone effect hits Andhra Pradesh which creates devastation when Nageswara Rao also accompanies Rama Rao and they again collect donations for their welfare. There, a transformation occurs and Rama Rao decides to spend the rest of his life in public service. He consults various scholarly people and even the public requests him to step into politics. At that moment, the ruling party starts questioning Rama Rao's son-in-law and Minister of Communication Nara Chandrababu Naidu, but he maintains patience. Simultaneously, the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh are continuously changing the center's command. Bhavanam Venkatarami Reddy, the childhood friend of Rama Rao, becomes the 8th Chief Minister and he invites Rama Rao to his swearing-in ceremony. There, Rama Rao meets a Congress party leader Nadendla Bhaskar Rao who, too, encourages him, with an assurance of his backing. At the age of 60, Rama Rao decides to establish a party, for which his entire family opposes except his son Nandamuri Harikrishna. Though Basavaramatarakam is disinterested, she respects her husband's decision and gives her warm comfort. Finally, the movie ends with Rama Rao announcing his party name, Telugu Desam.</p>
