              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Vault tells a story about a group of small time criminals in 1975 who attempt to pull off the biggest heist in American history: stealing over $30 million from the Mafia in the smallest state in the union, Rhode Island.
Deuce (Theo Rossi) & Chucky (Clive Standen) enter a small business shop in 1975 and rob it off all the cash. Karyn (Samira Wiley) was working the cash till that day and is not happy that her day was interrupted by Deuce. Deuce like her attitude and spunk. That night Deuce picks up Karyn and brings him to his home to introduce to his ma (Dorothy Lyman). They end up kissing at the end of the night.
Both are caught red handed at their next heist, when their getaway driver Tommy, panics and bails.Raymond (Chazz Palminteri) Is the head of the crime mafia in Rhode Island. Gerry (Don Johnson) has worked for Raymond for many many years and wants Raymod to make him a "made man" and accept him into his crime family. Raymond refuses.Deuce and Chucky are put in the same prison that co-incidentally hosted Raymond and Gerry. Gerry notices them in a brawl and is impressed with their fighting abilities. Gerry recruits Deuce and Chucky for his war against Raymond.
When Deuce and Chucky get out, Gerry wants them to rob a fur shop, which is a front for the mob's safety deposit boxes. Gerry even assembles his crew for Deuce and Chucky to lead, which includes Buddy Providence (William Forsythe), Buddy Roxbury (Sean Ringgold) and Buddy Barrington (Eric Lutes). To protect identities, they call each other buddy and the place they are from. The robbery goes as planned and the crew makes away with $ 30 MM of the mob's hidden money.2 months later, it looks like Deuce and Chucky got away with it as they are living it up in Las Vegas. A few months later, the money has all but run out. Their colleagues have been picked out and killed one by one. Both Deuce and Chucky are in hiding. Deuce thinks that Gerry has gotten greedy and is eliminating the crew so that he doesn't have to pay them anything at all. They were promised 70K per person for 7 guys, and in exchange Gerry got $ 30 MM.
Chucky comes out to meet Deuce and initially wants to kill him. But Deuce guesses that Chucky is there to kill him and puts a gun on him instead. They have a tearful re-union and decide not to kill each other.Eventually it is Karyn who talks to the police and turns Deuce in. Detective Caretti (John Fiore) informs Deuce that Chucky was killed for disobeying a direct order and not killing Deuce. Deuce is heartbroken and spills the beans with a full confession. Thats when Caretti reveals that Chucky is alive and in custody.
Chucky was jailed for 10 yrs for the robbery. Deuce was let go since he cooperated. Chucky and Deuce were never friends again.
None of the money was ever recovered. Raymond eventually got out of prison and died in 1984 a free man. Gerry was arrested for his role in the heist and served 10 yrs.Turns out it was Raymond who had ordered Gerry to steal the deposit boxes as he wanted to own the entire town.</p>
