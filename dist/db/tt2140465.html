              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Four years later in their marriage, Tanu (Kangana Ranaut) and Manu (R Madhavan) visit marriage counselors where they start bickering at each other. Because of Tanu's various allegations, Manu gets enraged, and is later taken by the doctors into custody suspecting his mental health. Tanu's friend Payal (Swara Bhaskar) calls her from India and confides that her newborn baby's father is not her husband Jassi. An amused Tanu decides to return to her hometown, Kanpur. While leaving London, Tanu rings Manu's friend Pappi (Deepak Dobriyal) in Delhi and tells him to come to London and release Manu.At Kanpur in her parents home, Tanu finds a crafty law student called Chintu (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub) has become a lodger who refuses to pay or leave. Chintu befriends Tanu and slowly develops a crush on her, being bemused by her antics. Tanu also comes to know that her ex-boyfriend, Raja Awasthi (Jimmy Shergill), is getting engaged to another girl. Pappi reaches London and gets Manu out and they reach India, where Manu sends a legal notice to Tanu, but she does not respond.One day Manu goes to Delhi University to give a medical speech, where he sees Kusum (Kangana Ranaut), a young Haryanvi student-athlete, who looks like Tanu. He slowly gets obsessed with Kusum and keeps following her despite Pappi's warning. One day after Kusum confronts them, Manu tells her about Tanu. Kusum sympathizes and they gradually develop feelings for each other. Manu tells Kusum he wants to marry her and meets Omi (Rajesh Sharma), her elder brother. Omi has no issues with Manu but shows a picture of the boy his wife wanted Kusum to marry, who turns out to be Raja.Chintu gets jealous of Raja going around with Tanu and tells her father about it. He even sends Manu a nasty legal notice for a divorce, without Tanu's consent, but Manu responds by agreeing, which shocks Tanu. She confronts Chintu who says he loves her but Raja shoves him off. Raja also discovers his engagement is being called off as Manu is going to marry the new girl in his life. Both Raja and Tanu are enraged and decide to go to Delhi to confront Manu.Manu, Kusum and Pappi travel to Chandigarh to convince Komal, Payal's sister-in-law whom Pappi loves, to run away from her wedding with Pappi instead. There Kusum is mistaken by everyone at the wedding as Tanu, including by Payal, who tells her she had a test-tube baby as Jassi was impotent. Kusum gets frantic on hearing these secrets and gives Payal a karate chop which knocks her out. She also gives Komal a karate chop too and they smuggle her to Jhajjar, where Kusum's villagers are waiting. But once her family finds out she loves Manu, they attack Manu and Pappi and lock up Kusum. Omi arrives and saves the day with his logic. The village agrees to Kusum and Manu's marriage.As wedding preparations start Tanu and Raja reach there with Jassi, Payal, their baby and Manu's parents. Tanu makes fun of Kusum who snaps at her saying she is a state-level champion who is independent, loving and honest. She also reveals the truth behind Payal's baby in front of Jassi. A shocked and drunk Tanu meets Manu at night who brutally brushes off her love. In the morning, Tanu tells Kusum she is sorry about her behavior and would like to stay and help at their wedding.On the wedding evening, Tanu gets drunk and dances in front of Manu in the Baaraat. Her parents arrive with Chintu and are shocked to see Tanu shattered as Manu leaves for his marriage. Tanu sits quietly as Manu is marrying Kusum, until Kusum stops confronts Manu, who confesses he still loves Tanu and cannot marry Kusum. Kusum honorably releases him and walks off, to break down privately.Tanu and Manu are joyously reunited. Kusum comes out to find drunken Chintu, delivering an angry speech. She gives him a karate chop. Tanu and Manu again argue about a tie she had gifted him. Meanwhile, Raja and Kusum end up having a friendly chat together.</p>
