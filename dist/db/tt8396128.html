              <p><strong>Classificação:</strong> 7.2</p>
              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Champa Badki (Radhika Madan) and Genda Chhutki (Sanya Malhotra) live in a small town in Rajasthan. They are sisters who quarrel about everything from stolen Bidis to torn clothes. Dipper Naradmuni (Sunil Grover) is their nosy neighbor, who is always on the lookout for an opportunity to make the sisters go to war, while their father Bechara Bapu Meena (Vijay Raaz), a single parent, is always trying to make peace between the warring sisters.Tharki Patel (Saanand Verma) is a lech and constantly looks for opportunities to lure the girls into bed with him.
Bapu runs an illegal mining operation in the village, earning small change to keep the house going. The Govt officer (Lankesh Bhardwaj) wants Bapu to pay a Rs 4 Lakhs bribe to renew the license or vacate the mine. He also tells Bapu that if he marries one of his daughters to Tharki, he can keep the mines for life.Chutki meets Vishnu (Abhishek Duhan), who works in the Indian Army and is interested in her. Meanwhile Badki meets Jagan (Namit Das) and the sisters start spending time with their beaus. Badki wants to open her own dairy, while Chutki wants to study and move to the city.
But both need Rs 2 Lakhs each to fulfill their dreams. Their boyfriends agree to pay, but after marriage.
Bapu applies for a loan to pay the bribe but is rejected. He then travels to Delhi to beg his relatives for the money. While he is gone, the girls make a deal with their boyfriends to fuel their dreams.Bapu comes back and is really angry that both his girls are having an affair. He tells them that he will marry one of them off to keep his mining license. Bapu takes the money from Tharki. Decision will be made by toss given that none of the two wants to get married to Tharki. The toss, done publicly, comes to Badki. Dipper sows a doubt in Badki's mind by saying that he thought the toss came out differently, but for some reason Bapu decided to put Badki forward.The night before the wedding, Badki runs away with Jagan. Tharki comes over and demands Chutki's hand in marriage as compensation. But at the night of the wedding Chutki also runs away with Vishnu, with Dipper's help. It now turns out that Jagan and Vishnu are bros and the girls have married into the same house.
Tharki drags Bapu to Panchayat, but Dipper manages the situation well and arranges for the grooms to pay back Tharki's money. Bapu warns the girls against marrying in the same house, but the girls are sure. But soon, the guys leave for their respective jobs and leave the girls at home alone. The girls have to put their dreams on hold as the money the guys had was given to Tharki to pay off Bapu's loan.Years pass and nothing much changes. Dipper arrives one day, and the girls open up on how miserable they both are living together, while their men are gone for months together. Dipper advises them to split the house. But the farm is worth only Rs 2 Lakhs, so Dipper promises them to get Rs 4 Lakhs for it. Dipper approaches Tharki (who is getting married to a Nepali girl) and tells him that if he buys the farm for Rs 4 Lakhs, he can drive a wedge between the brothers and cause misery in the girl's lives. Tharki still hasn't forgotten his humiliation and agrees to the plan.The girls keep their end of the bargain by starting fights which they involve their husbands in, and eventually they start fighting. The girls get what they want as the land is sold to Tharki. Chutki moves to the city and Badki gets her dairy. Now Chutki's dream fails as she is bad at English, Badki falls sick living between the animals all the time. But with hard work and a little luck, both girls succeed at their goals. Badki gets an Govt award for running a successful coop dairy business.The sibling rivalry doesn't stop and the 2 are still jealous of each other's success. The rivalry turns to hatred and Chutki loses her vision and Badki loses her voice. Doctors diagnose both and come to the conclusion that the issue is not physical, but psychological. A deep mental issue has caused their brain to refuse accepting the signals from their organs. The family suspects it's the sibling rivalry.Dipper advises Bapu to bring the girls back together. While on his way back home, Bapu dies, which brings the girls together at the funeral. They start fighting and suddenly Badki can speak and Chukti can see. Turns out Bapu was just acting dead and he comes back alive when the girls start fighting.</p>
