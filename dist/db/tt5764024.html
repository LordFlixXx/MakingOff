              <p><strong>Classificação:</strong> 5.3</p>
              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Adi Gunjal (Aditya Roy Kapur) is a video game developer under his boss (Prahlad Kakkar). On his first day at work, Adi pitches an idea for a new video game called Mumbai 2.0, which his boss loves. Adi gets the go ahead to develop the game in 5 months.
Bantu (Jasmeet Singh Bhatia) is Adi's best friend. Adi has rented a room from Gopi Srivastava (Naseeruddin Shah). Gopi is forward looking, modern retiree judge with a modern day thinking. He used to be Adi's elder brother Ravi's (Vijayant Kohli) teacher and hence agreed to rent a room to Adi. While Gopi is liberal, but he is also very strict.Adi accidentally meets Tara Agnihotri (Shraddha Kapoor) at his friend's wedding. Tara is planning to pursue her architecture studies in Paris, while Adi wants to achieve big in US as a video game developer. They soon start hanging out together and fall in love. They are both fun loving people who have their own budding careers.
Tara goes on an Architecture tour to Ahmedabad and Adi accompanies her. Adi learns that Tara's father is separated from her mother (Kitu Gidwani). They used to fight a lot, and Tara was made part of a custody battle. She believes that marriages are messy and has decided that marriage is not for her.Adi and Tara decide to have a live-in relationship instead, and Tara decides to move into Adi's place. Tara and Adi do not want marriage to come in the way of their fun life or their careers.
Tara's broke up with ex-boyfriend Romi (Eesh Kakkar) as he wanted to get married to her.Gopi is a romantic himself and loves his wife very much, even though she is suffering from Alzhimer's and has started to forget things. Gopi becomes Adi's relationship guide.Tara and Adi speak to Gopi about their proposed living arrangements. Tara says that she will eventually leave for her architecture course in America, and hence this is a temporary arrangement.
Gopi is initially opposed to the live-in relationship but has to give in when his wife takes a liking to Tara, and he sees Tara as a good companion for his wife.Adi & Tara wish to spend their time with each other before they go their separate ways for their respective careers. Tara and Adi live happily, being playful with each other.
One day, Adi's brother & his family come to visit. Adi & Tara try their best to hide their relationship, but Adi's Bhabhi (Sarika Singh) figures out Adi & Tara's live in relationship and warns Tara against falling in love.One midnight, Tara has a conversation with Gopi. She tells him that she might get her visa approved for going to Paris, and that it's hard for her to leave Adi and go far away. She says that 6 months ago she was very sure about pursuing her career, but now she is in 2 minds.
The next day Tara goes to Jaipur for her business, and Adi starts to miss her terribly. When Tara comes back from her trip, Adi was gone for a few days. She learns from Bantu that Adi goes to very dangerous places in Mumbai to do some authentic research for his video game, to make it look realistic. Tara is livid with Adi for taking on such high risks with his life. She realizes that she really cares for Adi.Upon seeing the love and patience his house owner Gopi has for his wife, Charu (Leela Samson), an Alzheimer's patient, who one day even forgets the way to her own house, they begin to understand the importance of each other's presence in their life.
Tara's mother finds out about her live-in relationship with Adi and takes her marriage proposal to Adi's brother. Tara is livid at her mother interfering in her life and putting spies on her. Tara's mother says that she is being considerate by accepting the boy that Tara has selected for herself.Adi's game concept is a hit. Soon, Adi is selected to develop his skills in video games and to go to the United States. He tells his colleague that it's hard for him to leave Tara. The next day, both of them make an agreement to enjoy themselves to the maximum for the 10 days left before they separate. Nearing the last day, they begin to have little fights and arguments, which don't last long.One day, Charu goes missing again, as she did when she forgot her house address. While looking for her, they continue arguing about their relationship and finally Adi proposes to Tara, and they decide to get married.
Post marriage, both of them continue to accomplish their own dreams, one in Paris, another in US. And they live happily married and in love.</p>
