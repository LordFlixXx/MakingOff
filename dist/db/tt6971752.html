              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> The story is about a boy Mudit Sharma (Ayushmann Khurrana), a Gurgaon Boy in marketing job, who falls in love with Sugandha (Bhumi Pednekar). Shy of nature, Mudit tries all the possible ways to talk with her but fails. Finally, he decides to send her an online marriage proposal after talking to his mother.
Sugandha lives with her parents father (Neeraj Sood), mother Vimla (Seema Bhargava) and has an uncle (Brijendra Kala). While Mudit has father (Chittaranjan Tripathy), mother (Supriya Shukla), uncle Gabloo (Rahul Chauhan)The marriage proposal is received by Sugandha's family. Sugandha's uncle takes offense that her father (his younger brother) has finalized Sugandha's marriage proposal without consulting him. Sugandha is confused since it is her marriage and even, she didn't know that her marriage proposal has been accepted.
Now, Sugandha wanted a movie like love marriage, where there is family discord, she runs away with the groom, and her father yells at her husband vowing to never see his face again. She is dismayed that her dream of a love marriage is not fulfilled, and her family likes Mudit's marriage proposal.Sugandha is determined to get her love story and barges into Mudit's office. After meeting, both realize that they love each other. An engagement party is also conducted where the extended family arrives and celebrates the occasion.
Sugandha takes her time deciding whether to accept the proposal (by giving the ceremonial token money to Mudit) and later calls it her first major decision for her own life. A formal marriage proposal is exchanged between their families.But one day, when Sugandha's parents are out of town, Mudit and Sugandha try becoming intimate and when they finally land in bed, Mudit says that he needs to use the washroom. But when he comes out, he takes his shirt, wears it and starts to leave. When Sugandha asks what happened, he without saying anything, simply signals his problem with the help of a biscuit, making Sugandha realize that Mudit suffers from Erectile Dysfunction.
Now Sugandha is really looking forward to having sex and also loves Mudit. She decides to tackle the problem head on and is determined to make her relationship with Mudit work.
Sugandha's best friend is Ginni (Anshul Chauhan), while Mudit's best friend is Duggal (Manuj Sharma). Both try to help their friends in their own way.Mudit and Sugandha try different ways to solve the problems (Porn, Viagra, sexy lingerie) but fail, and when Mudit senses the marriage is near, he decides to cancel it. They both get into heated argument and Sugandha leaves saying that she will be waiting for him and Baraat.
Eventually, Mudit along with his relatives, leave for Haridwar, where the marriage is scheduled to take place. In the journey, Mudit constantly receives calls from someone stating that he is his well-wisher and knows about his problem. When he reached Haridwar, Sugandha picks up the phone, scolds and abuses the unknown person, and suddenly realizes, that well-wisher was Sugandha's father.
He got worried after seeing Sugandha depressed for multiple weeks and decided to check her WhatsApp.When Mudit and his father-in-law consult a doctor (Gopal Datt) (who is a veterinarian), the doctor just informs him that it's all because of tension. 'Don't take tension and the problem will be solved', the doctor suggests.
But now the issue is visible to both families. Sugandha's father wants Sugandha to run away from the wedding. Mudit's parents are adamant that the issue is with Sugandha and not Mudit.
One day before the marriage, again Sugandha and Mudit try getting intimate again in order to check if the issue has been resolved. Coming out of room they find every family member waiting excitedly about whether they succeeded in getting intimate or not. Mudit says that he had an erection, but Sugandha said he didn't. The families again get worried.Sugandha, next day, sees Mudit with another girl on his bed (Mudit's friends had arranged an ex-girlfriend for Mudit, without him being aware of it), misunderstands him.
Sugandha feels that Mudit can have sex with a random woman, but not her, which means Mudit must not love Sugandha. She and leaves heartbroken.The family started saying rubbish to Mudit, and he angrily, lambastes both his and her parents for their insensitivity towards the issue and for not helping Sugandha and himself make a life together. Mudit stands up for Sugandha and their relationship against family/societal expectations. He rejects toxic masculinity, and they together define their marriage as a team of equal players.He spots Sugandha coming down from rope-way and Mudit was going up so he jumps from one cable car to Sugandha's. He clears all the misunderstandings and confesses his love. The wedding takes place.In the last, they get married. In the ending narration, Mudit says nothing happened on the first night, nothing happened on their honeymoon. And in the last scene, some prayers are going on. Mudit calls Sugandha inside the room. They hug each other and land in bed and it's implied that finally the marriage is consummated.</p>
