              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Mandy Page (Nicola Posener) loves Christmas and is proud of her hobby and craft store that holds classes, hosts parties and private events. As Mandy sifts through a box of donated items and flips through the pages of a classic book, THE CHRISTMAS CAROL, a coin drops out of an envelope addressed to Santa. It's a little girl's request for Santa to please give the coin to her father who died in the war, "he would love it." The letter is dated Dec 11, 1947. "Judith...who are you," she wonders.
Mandy is determined to find Judith and return the coin. In the same box is a hymn book from the Creek Hill Chapel. She drives to the Chapel and meets Jonah (Brad Johnson) who is there renovating and is the one who donated the books he found in a back room. When Mandy explains her mission, Jonah likes what he sees and the instant chemistry between them prompts him to offer his help in finding the now 70-year-old woman whose name is Judith. Jonah asks the pastor (Paul D. Hunt) of the chapel, but he is not familiar with a woman named Judith and old church records were ruined several years ago when a pipe burst. Mandy goes to the antique book store around the corner to have the coin appraised. She learns it is a proof coin that could be worth as much as $30,000.
Jonah volunteers to help find Judith. Their search begins at the Everett Town Hall where they hope to find a list of soldiers from the area who served in World War II. While this results in volumes of data, they stumble across the name "Victor Franklin" listed in the back of the book. Jonah searches the local online property records and discovers and address and phone number of a 78-year-old man. Failing to reach him on the phone, Jonah and Mandy meet at his address. They discover he is a recent transplant from California.
The visit, however, gives Mandy the idea that they should look in high school yearbooks to find Victor Franklin. The pair visits central high where the librarian reluctantly lets them take the yearbooks out for the weekend. There, Jonah gets an upsetting phone call from a collection agency. After hours at the craft store, Jonah and Mandy create ugly Christmas sweaters and discuss the Dear Santa letters they wrote as kids.
Jonah borrows the coin to see if a friend could track down who sold it. Though that turns out to be a dead end, Jonah does buy pie which he and Mandy enjoy together. Jonah gets a call to finish a job for which he has no workmen., Mandy helps him out by doing some painting at the project. They go to the town's Christmas event together and find a place in the town square when they can write and mail a letter to Santa. As they drink hot chocolate, Mandy inquires what is on Jonah's Christmas list. After wishing his bills were paid, he says he would like a good book, perhaps a spy thriller that has been made into a movie. As they are about to kiss, they are interrupted by a call to join Santa's arrival.
The next day Jonah calls Mandy hoping she will help him prepared his Christmas menu for his parent. When Mandy looks for a cookbook, she also finds a spy novel. In Mandy's presence, a letter out of Jonah's mailbox accidentally drops at Mandy's feet, she sees a PAST DUE stamp on it and realizes Jonah has financial issues. They gather toys from receptacles for the county toy drive. Mandy tells her coworker Gabby (Renny Grames) that she wants to help Jonah with his financial issues. She goes to the pastor of the chapel to ask for a favor.
Back at the store, many tips over a box she placed the coin in and discovers it is missing. She blatantly accuses Jonah of stealing it to pay his bills. He stares at her in utter disbelief, turns and walks away, taking with him any chance for a happy life together or helping to find Judith. Mandy realizes she hasn't returned the yearbooks as promised. She goes to Jonah's house to collect them Jonah leaves Mandy standing at the door tell her he will return the yearbooks he has himself. The next morning, Jonah finds Victor Franklin's photo in one of the Everett High yearbooks. At the craft shop, Mandy drops the letter and in picking it up, notices the coin in the floor vent. She calls Jonah to meet at the coffee shop. Mandy apologizes and Jonah gives her an envelop with copies of the yearbook photo of Victor Franklin and his cousin Judith Lewis. When Mandy looks up, Jonah has left.
Gabby and Mandy spend the evening going through war records identifying Lewis's who could be Judith's father. The pastor at the church pays his balance to Jonah before it is due telling Jonah that a beautiful angel told him he might need it. At his home, Jonah finds the Christmas gift that Mandy placed under Jonah's tree. Back at the clerk's office, Mandy and the county clerk (Nicole Marcks) search marriage records and find that Colin Lewis was the father of Judith Lewis who married William Cross. That night, Gabby and Mandy call all the Judith Crosses in the county. Gabby invites Mandy to spend Christmas with her family.
The next morning, Mandy gets a call from Judith Cross's daughter. On her way to deliver to deliver the book and the letter with the coin, she turns around. Jonah is working in the church when his mother call checking on his progress on Christmas dinner. Mandy stops at Jonah's home delivering the pie for Christmas dinner. She asks Jonah to accompany her to deliver Judith's letter just as she wished for in her letter to Santa. When they arrive, they learn that Judith and her grandchildren have gone to the town square for the tree lighting. They search for a woman in a dark blue coat and pink scarf. They finally find Judith Cross (Anne Sward) in the crowd. Judith is overjoyed and chocked up to receive the very sentimental gift from Mandy and Jonah. Jonah admit that he asked Santa for Mandy to love him. As the Christmas tree is lit, they finally kiss for the first time.</p>
