              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Nirma Sahastrabuddhe (Mithila Palkar) is a Mandarin translator who works at a travel agency. Nirma's company arranges tours for Chinese tourists in Mumbai and Nirma is assigned as the tour coordinator. She often gets the least attractive assignments (to like Dharavi) as she is often late to work.One day she buys her own car, and is very happy and excited for it. But on the very night, her new car gets stolen. She reports the stealing to police Siddhivinayak Cop (Abhishek Bhalerao), but later meets a newly arrested thief, who tells her that those useless police will never find her car, and if she wants to find her car, it has to be within three days, or her car will either be transported out of the city or be taken apart for spare parts. He also suggest her visit someone nicknamed artist for help, saying artist is a legendary conman and the only person able to recover her car within three days.She meets Artist (Abhay Deol) the next day, who is indeed a legendary conman and a cooking lover. Artist makes Nirma very nervous and she ends up macing herself (she wanted to mace him). Nirma begs him to help her.
Artist agrees to help her after Nirma helps Artist with translating the manual for a Chinese safe. Using his broad connection in his profession (he goes to a school, which is being used a warehouse to sort coin change and supply the same to all the banks in Mumbai. The loose change comes from beggars all over Mumbai. Govt pays Rs 100 for every Rs 90 of change), he easily finds the whereabouts of the car. UdanKhatola (Arun Kushwath) runs the coin operations and is Artist's friend. UK promises Artist to find the car for him.Nirma is also being yelled at work. Her boss is rude to her and overlooks her for any meaningful assignments. She cries to Artist, who makes her realize that this is not a matter to be depressed about. He advises her to explore other options at work.
Artists get news that UK has located the car. UK requests Artist to gift a mobile in exchange for the car. Artist tests Nirma by getting her to buy an iPhone with fake currency, but she panics. The store guy chases her and hands over the phone to her. Later, Artist reveals that the currency wasn't fake.
Nirma and artist arrive to collect her car with the same guy (Murtuza) who stole it from Nirma, they find it has already been destroyed, leaving Nirma very saddened.However, Murtuza cheated him and gave him the wrong information. Nirma's car is not destroyed, but instead delivered to a gangster Faiyaz Bhai (Vijay Raaz). Artist finds this from UK, but decides not to do anything.
Faiyaz Bhai has a pet goat named Bahubali (he bought the goat at auction for Rs 21 Lakhs) and loves him very much (he feeds him the best of everything).Meanwhile Nirma quits her job. People from Animal Planet come to Faiyaz Bhai to do a documentary on Bahubahli. they take a few pics, which Faiyaz gets published in the local newspaper. Nirma sees the paper in which Bahubali is posing next to her car. She can recognize the car from the torn sticker of a Baba that her mother had made her stick to the back of the car, for good luck. Nirma confronts Artist.
Artist does not want to try to take it from Faiyaz Bhai because he cannot take the risk of messing with Faiyaz Bhai, but Nirma manages to persuade him.Nirma and artist comes up with the idea of kidnapping Bahubali, and asks Faiyaz Bhai to return her car as exchange. Artist buys a goat that looks exactly the same as Bahubali. Artist finds that Faiyaz has asked for a makeup person to dress up Bahubali before its documentary shooting with animal planet. He Gets Nirma inserted as the makeup person.
Nirma is alone with Bahubhali and lures it with a chocolate and brings him out of the house, where Artist is waiting with the look alike. The switch is made.Faiyaz Bhai shortly finds it's artist and Nirma that kidnapped Bahubali (It was Faiyaz's caterer Farooq (Narendra Khatri) who had seen Artist buy a goat at the local market. Farooq had even commented that the goat had 3 toes, which was supposed to be good luck. When Farooq met Faiyaz, he saw the goat and was able to recognize it and knew that Artist was involved in the kidnapping). Artist also learns they have been exposed (Farooq calls Artist and warns him), so he and Nirma run from Faiyaz Bhai's men.
Later, Nirma returns Bahubali to Faiyaz Bhai and apologizes to him, saying she only wanted to have her car back, but later realized it was wrong because Faiyaz Bhai thought of Bahubali as a child and must be very sad to lose him, just as sad as she was when she lost her car.Faiyaz Bhai is very moved, and returns Nirma's car to her. Nirma gets a job with Bank of China, and becomes a client of her ex-boss. Artist goes on to start in Super Chef TV show.</p>
