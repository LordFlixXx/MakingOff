              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> Professional thief Jack Tulliver (Wesley Snipes) and his crew pull off a meticulously planned armored car heist (the 3 armored cars are carrying $20 MM in casino prize money. 7 seconds used on the detonator timers to blow off the doors). The detonators fail to work and Jack and his 3 teams pull back. The HQ commands all 14 trucks to return to the depot as a result. Suza (Georgina Rylance) is Jack's insider at the armored car company.
Tuliver is ex-military & was called by his friend Bull for this job. Bull's girlfriend Suza (whom Jack was having sex with, on the side) provided the inside knowledge to loot the vehicles.Jack and his crew infiltrate the depot with a fake armored car, which gets in with help from Suza, who helps them avoid all the security traps. Vanderbrink (Adrian Lukis) (the owner of the security firm) is conducting a security briefing of all his teams when Suza locks the room from outside, giving Jack and his men free reign to loot all 13 cars (1 real car is still outside). Armored car #4 had 2 tough guys carrying a precious cargo, which they had refused to leave alone. When Jack and his men were looting the other cars, they come out shooting. Jack knocks them out with a grenade and makes away with their cargo (which was handcuffed to their wrist)..As Jack and his men leave the depot are ambushed (The crew had blanks in their guns) in Bucharest by a group of Romanian racketeers. This rogue group, tipped off to the heist by an unknown turncoat, kills Tulliver's associate Bull (Andrei Ionescu) and most of his crew.Tulliver escapes with a mysterious sealed case that was the most valuable part of the stolen loot. After car-jacking (Tuliver saves sergeant Anders from being shot from his pursuers & she helps him escape) Sgt. Kelly Anders' (Tamzin Outhwaite) (From NATO military police) car, he makes a getaway through Bucharest, but leaves Anders under the suspicion of her fellow officers. Captain Szabo (Tomi Cristin) of Bucharest Police department finds is suspicious that Anders happened to be 3 hours away from the nearest NATO base, and helped a suspect get away with a $65 MM case, and the suspect later allowed her to just leave safely.Jack hides the painting in a locker at the railway station.
Meanwhile, Tulliver tries to save Spanky (Dhobi Oparei) (Jack suspected Spanky as all of his ex-military friends were killed in the ambush, but Spanky somehow had managed to escape) who has been captured by Alexie Kutchinov (Pete Lee-Wilson), a sadistic Russian millionaire gangster & an art dealer in charge of the Romanian racketeers that ambushed Tulliver. Jack contacts Bull's brother Mikail Mercea (Serge Soric) and asks for help, but Mikail is angry at Jack for Bull's death. Jack convinces Mikail that he also lost 12 men and is angry about it. Jack tells Mikail that Bull's girl Suza was the insider at the armored car company. Mikail tells Jack that Alexsei is looking for him.
Mikail delivers Jack to Alexsei (Jack tells Mikail was Alexsei's men killed bull), and Alexsei tortures him & Suza for the painting. When Suza is about to be set on fire, Jack agrees to take Alexsei to the painting.Anders does her own investigations and finds that the armored car company was transporting a $65 MM Van Gogh painting that day. Anders now thinks that Jack's case carries that very painting. She meets the recipient of the consignment Mr. Grapini (Adrian Pintea). Grapini is an art gallery owner and was supposed to sell the Van Gogh on behalf of the banks who wanted to recover their debt from the owner. A professor who was supposed to authenticate the painting says it's a forgery.
Jack had called Anders to figure out what was in the case, but Anders wants something in return. Anders visits Bull's wife and learns about Suza and how she brought the heist to bull and Bull involved Jack (Jack and Bull had served together in the NATO army and were comrade in arms), as the job was too big. She tells Anders about Bull's brother Mikail. Anders meets Mikail. Mikail tells Anders that Grapini was acting on behalf of Alexsei.Tuliver escapes (when he is taken to retrieve the painting) & is arrested by Anders. Jack convinces Anders that she can turn over the painting and the money to the police, but he wants her help to rescue his friends. They storm Alexsei's place & kill the goons & find that Bull's girlfriend is Alexsei's bitch & had set them all up. Alexsei believed that the painting was a fake & had it insured for $65MM. He didn't want it appraised & thus wanted it stolen, so he could get the insurance money.Jack and Sgt. Anders are saved by Bull's brother Mikail Mercea (Serge Soric), a Romanian mobster who shoots Alexie and the turncoat Suza (Georgina Rylance) to avenge his brother's death.
During the aftermath, Tulliver and Anders learn that the sealed case contained an actual valuable painting that was originally believed to be a forgery.</p>
