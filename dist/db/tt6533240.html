              <p><strong>Sinopse:</strong> When the body of a young woman is found on a lumber truck, Detective Walter Marshall (Henry Cavill) suspects that the victim lappet to her death to escape from a captor. A breakthrough is inadvertently made in the case when former judge Michael Cooper's (Ben Kingsley) vigilante sting to capture a child predator result in his ward Lara (Eliana Jones) being kidnapped (Cooper uses Lara as a sex bait to lure sexual offenders and then "sterilizes" them by removing their balls surgically and making them impotent). Michael is arrested by the police when Lara is abducted and Michael is forced to reveal his tracker to Marshall, who believes Michael and commits Police forces to track down Lara, leading to the discovery.Michael's own family was killed by a sexual predator that he acquitted, who struck again. Thus, he started partnering with Lara (a sexual assault survivor herself) to serve vigilante justice)Through a tracker in Lara's earrings, Marshall finds her and other captive young women in a mansion owned by Simon Stulls (Brendan Fletcher), a seemingly-mentally disabled man. Simon is arrested and the police attempt to determine if he is responsible for the abductions. In investigating Simon's background, they discover that he was born from sexual assault and his mother attempted suicide before giving birth to him.
Rachael (Alexandra Daddario) is the police profiling officer who spends time in understanding Simon. Simon had equipment to make his victims deaf. Lara and Michael and not thankful to Marshall as Lara says that Police only shows up after the sexual assault has already happened.Rachael tries all sorts of shrink techniques and figures that Simon was severely abused by his mother, and was kept in a cage like a monkey, before she committed suicide.
While Simon is in custody, the police force finds themselves apparently being targeted by another attacker (which leads to the death of 6 cops investigating Simon's house). Technician Matthew Quinn (Nathan Fillion) is killed in a car bombing and fellow technician Glasow (Mpho Kohao) is forced to free Simon when the life of his infant daughter is threatened.Glasow had earlier helped Marshall hack Simon's secure drive and figure out that he was chatting with someone called Hacker71, who had access to military grade explosives and fuses. The police use this information to narrow down on a suspect. The ex-military man shoots himself when Marshall tells him that the equipment he sold was used to kidnap and sexually assault over 10 women.The police recapture Simon after he has killed his father (Rachael and Marshall figure out that maybe Simon's father was the owner of textile factory where his mom was sexually assaulted. They figure out his address and reach the location to find Simon there and his father dead), just as Cooper discovers that Lara is missing. Believing Simon to be responsible, Cooper ambushes his police transport when he is surprised by another man who looks exactly like Simon. It is then revealed that Simon is in fact a pair of identical twins, with one being behind the kidnappings and the other truly being mentally disabled. The twins kill Cooper and capture police profiling officer Rachel Chase (Alexandra Daddario) before escaping.Using a tracker that Simon left in the police station, a team led by Marshall locates the twins by an icy lake where they are holding Rachel and Lara. Lara escapes and Marshall takes the mentally disabled brother hostage to convince the malevolent brother to release Rachel. After Rachel is freed, Marshall tells the mentally disabled twin to hug his brother. The mentally disabled twin complies, causing both brothers to fall through the ice and drown.Afterwards, Lara reads a letter from Cooper thanking her for all that she has done. Marshall visits his daughter Faye (Emma Tremblay) accompanied by Rachel, implying that Marshall and Rachel have entered into a relationship.</p>
